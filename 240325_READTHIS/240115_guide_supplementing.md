Supplementing
    1. You have to believe you can imagine a solution. 
    2. You have to imagine the solution
    3. You have to practice: 5m ---> 4-8 hours

For some reason the process of clearing the dark cloud / spiritual smog can be draining. We've found we can also supplement ourselves with our imaginations.  We are supernatural beings with supernatural needs, what is best for the human body is not enough for us. 

The process is the same, just imagine: 
    1. Produce section at the grocery store
    2. Spice rack at the grocery store 
    3. Vitamin Shoppe / GNC 
    4. A large, well stocked crystal store 
    5. Pharmacy area of a drug store 
    6. The periodic table of elements
