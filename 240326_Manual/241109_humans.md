Some humans are hot spots, honey pots

If you have a headache, ask your deities to help

All they need to do is reach in and touch it

Sometimes, if its a sphere, the pain will litterally _move_

It might run around your head, down your throat, into your chest

That is the number one way you can tell if the pain is coming from your body or something else
