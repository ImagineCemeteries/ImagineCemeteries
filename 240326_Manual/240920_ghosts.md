# Eliminate the ghosts
- why? 
- How to tell if there are ghosts
- who cares just do it anyway 
- how to get deities to recognize a ghost
- you can't, its impossible to tell.  They are just everywhere
- what is going to piss deities off the most 
- paint a picture 

 

- ghosts are bad because they lie to you
- ghosts are bad because they spread rumors 
- ghosts are bad for canceling 
- ghosts are bad for being manipulative (its a simulation)
- ghosts are bad because if they have powers they torture you with them 
- ghosts are bad because they instigate 
- ghosts are bad because they are domineering 
- ghosts are bad because they want to control your every movement
- ghosts are bad because they compete with _each other_ for possession of your mind and body 
- ghosts are bad because they may have powers that they use for fun 
- ghosts are bad because they form mobs in order to attack humans and deities 
- ghosts are bad because they instigate and escalate, they know that deities weild strong powers and they set people up to look bad then go tell all the deities "what they did", and the deitites rush in out for blood unless you can calm them down
-ghosts are bad because you can't rely on them to tell the truth and you can't tell them from other deities without careful consideration 
- ghosts are bad because they want to take over your life 
- ghosts are bad because they can gang up on deities and pressure deities into doing things otherwise they wont leave you alone 
- whos the real tabatha
- The worst of them get a kick out of playing god but they're terrible at it 
- ghosts are bad because they play god


- if your human's spirit team has just 10 contributers, how can you expect to keep them all happy.  Then think of everyone's spirit team and 
- there has been an increase of ghost population 
- even with just two people, getting two humans and their spirit teams to get along can be impossible. 
- voices
- I'm proposing that spirit teams do more harm than good, we should wipe them out 
- they are the negative voice in your head 

& control 
- The people cheating judgement are not the ones to put your faith in
