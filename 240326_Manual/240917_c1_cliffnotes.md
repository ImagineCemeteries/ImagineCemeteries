# Disclaimer
I realize that not all of you can travel to far off places, the Drava River section is dedicated to those who can. Where they go, the dark cloud follows, and I'm sending them to a beautiful river that absorbs dark clouds. So they may take YOUR troubles with them to Europe, and leave them there. 

This will help you peripherally and the rest of this manual is useful to all of your kind. 

# The Drave & the Dark Cloud
A dark cloud is not only hanging over your head, it is a sentient spiritual species. We gotta get rid of it and get you guys and gals feeling better.

Go to the Drava river. There are a variety of beautiful cities you can visit along the river, in four countries: Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia. Pick one of them from the list below and take a few minutes out of your day to swim in its waters. 

Toblach, Italy
Lienz, Austria
Oberdrauburg, Austria
Möllbrücke, Austria
Spittal an der Drau, Austria
Villach, Austria
Dravograd, Slovenia
Radlje ob Dravi, Slovenia
Maribor, Slovenia
Ptuj,Slovenia
Ormož, Slovenia
Varaždin, Croatia
Legrad, Croatia

Feel better? Great, we're not done yet.  Buckle up! 

# ghosts vs deities: know what you are
After meeting and working with you through out the years, I've discovered that some deities identify as ghosts.  This is a HUGE problem because we need deities to save us from the ghosts, but if they think they're a ghost they aren't going to be very receptive.

2nd problem with deities that think they are ghosts: ghosts can be eliminated in cemetaries, yet deities are immune. This is crucial to understand because it is one of our major tactics.  Unfortunately, some deities are afraid, superstitious of cemetaries. 

So how do you _really_ know what you are? I have a chapter dedicated to it, but put simply: deities are self-reliant, they take matters into their own hands.  People often come to you for help and you take it upon yourself to assist.  But the big, scary test is that you can walk into a cemetary and walk back out again. 

# Cemetary - address 2 groups 
So you've been to the Drave for a bit and you don't feel like the world is on your shoulders anymore?  Well get ready because it gets better.  This next step is for everyone, we can't all go to the Drave but you have another option to eliminate the dark cloud. Go to the last cemetary you remember, put your hands on a tree in the cemetary.  The tree is IMPORTANT. Just being in a cemetary doesn't cut it.  Then you need to stay there, for at least 20 mintutes but an hour if you can. 

The thing about the Drava river is that it is almost instantaneous, as soon as you see it this cloud of nasty energy just drains off of you. The cemetary process is a little different and takes longer than just going for a dip, but it is neccessary for everyone whether you can travel internationally or not. 

What I'm teaching you to do here is how to eliminate spiritual smog.  Its like pollution but worse. ...

# now what 
# check the manual for imagine directions
The dark cloud is a sentient spiritual species and its contagious. The problem with both of these tactics is that you will eventually go back to where you came from, where the dark cloud is thriving.  It will feel better than it did before, but you might "catch" the dark cloud again. 

Two solutions: 
- the dark cloud will stick to deities, go back and foward between the Drave or a cemetary to slowly drain the energy 
- Learn to imagine. So you might not be feeling at your absolute best but I'm willing to bet you are a lot better off than when we first started talking.  BUT your regular terf, domicile, etc is still just dripping in bad vibes. You can't take your whole environment to Austria, so now what?!

Here's the cool part. You can simply envision these locations to remove spiritual smog from your surroundings. So you don't have to hide in a cemetary or at the Drave to feel that good, you can bring good back WITH you. 

I would start with the cemetary, I am extremely predjudiced against ghosts.  I believe they are causing all of our problems. There's a cartoon show on TV called "Human Resources," it is about humans and their so-called "spirit teams."  If every human has 10 spirits and 3 deities "watching over them" there is nothing you can do to make them happy, and none of them give a shit what their human really wants. 

a lot better, BUT the dark cloud is contagious and you will catch it again. 

# Who are our common enemies 
the dark cloud 
ghosts 






# Whats the why 
- because we don't understand it but it makes you feel better
- it lasts for a long time, months even 


 Like I said earlier, I wanted to give you the best results up front in case you didn't get this far.  But this is still worthy of your time and attention 






 


# You are supernatural beings with supernatural needs. 
Some may call this "energy vampires", but I disagree. Your kind has the ability to pull nutrients from your surroundings, it is so natural you don't even have to think about it. 

So if you are "malnurished" you are naturally going to absorb nurishment from your surroundings, including your human.  Its imperitive that your people take daily multi-vitamins at minimum. 

Proactively surrouding yourself with nutritious sources will improve your comfort and mood considerably.  Please take some time out of your day and travel to the following places, spend 5 minutes in each place: 

 1. Produce section at the grocery store
 2. Spice section at the grocery store 
 3. Vitamin Shoppe or GNC
 4. Biggest crystal store you know 
 5. The pharmacy at CVS or Walgreens 
 // 6. Extra Credit: The Periodic Table of Elements
 // 7. Essential oils
