# To Humans and Otherwise
This ENTIRE book is instructions for your spirit team, written in an order to eliminate problems the most efficiently.  You don't have to do anything but read it to them.  This book is designed to connect with the deities on your spirit team, help them eliminate the interlopers, help them help themselves and help them help YOU.  If you are feeling troubled read on for relief.  

As for spiritual folk, I realize that not all of you can travel to far off places, the next section on the Drava River is dedicated to those who can. Where they go, the dark cloud follows, and I'm sending them to a beautiful river that absorbs dark clouds. So they may take YOUR troubles with them to Europe, and leave them there. 

This will help you peripherally and the rest of this manual is useful to all of your kind. 


# Round 1: The Drave & the Dark Cloud
A dark cloud is not only hanging over your head, it is a sentient spiritual species. We gotta get rid of it and get you guys and gals feeling better.

Go to the Drava river. Trust me, just GO.  There are a variety of beautiful cities you can visit along the river, in four countries: Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia. Pick one of them from the list below and take a few minutes out of your day to swim in its waters. 

Toblach, Italy
Lienz, Austria
Oberdrauburg, Austria
Möllbrücke, Austria
Spittal an der Drau, Austria
Villach, Austria
Dravograd, Slovenia
Radlje ob Dravi, Slovenia
Maribor, Slovenia
Ptuj,Slovenia
Ormož, Slovenia
Varaždin, Croatia
Legrad, Croatia


# Shock / Whiplash 
We're proposing that angels, spirits, ghosts, deities, demons, whatever you identify as, can be possessed the same way that humans can be.  And the dark cloud seems to be pulling the strings.  It has a spiritual field that sticks to you, catching you in its web; the trip to the Drave washes that spiritual field off your spiritual body and allows you to think clearer than you were otherwise able to. 

This movement wasn't started, wasn't fought by saints.  We were just a bunch of people tangled up in this dark cloud, fighting each other over petty differences.  Then we realized there was something bigger than all of us, a common enemy, sabotaging us in everyway possible. Our relationships with each other, our goals, our mood.

After visiting the Drave, some of you, including most of us, will feel that a veil has been lifted.  A dark, evil veil.  You might be looking back on things and thinking, "what the fuck have I done?!"  Well, we're right there with you and we want you to join us.  We want you to want vengence. Vengence is eliminating the dark cloud.  

Once you get past the shock, you'll notice that you are stronger, faster, more perceptive.  Things come easier for you.  Help us make sure this never happens to anyone ever again. Keep reading and take the time you need, but don't stop here.  Don't punish yourself, just join us! 


# Now What? Meditation
- we need our frenimies 
We hope you feel better already but if you don't, don't worry, we're not done yet.  Buckle up! 

By going to the Drave, you have litterally taken a chunk out of the dark cloud and eliminated it.  The dark cloud is a sentient spiritual species and its contagious, in other words it will want to catch you again, even though it is weaker now that you've cleansed your energy.  

The dark cloud inhabits your surroundings the same way you and your humans inhabit your surroundings; you will eventually go back to where you came from, where the dark cloud is thriving.  The source of the dark cloud is probably in your usual environment, where you are sitting right now.  But, I'm willing to bet you are a lot better off than when we first started talking. You will feel better than you did before, but you might "catch" the dark cloud again from your surroundings. You can't take your whole environment to Austria, so now what? 

Here's the cool part.  If your regular terf, domicile, etc is still dripping in bad vibes,  in the same way you brought the dark cloud to the Drave, you can bring the Drave to the dark cloud. You can simply envision the river to start removing the dark cloud from your surroundings.  You've been to the Drave. In your home, where you sit, imagine that you are surrounded by the river. You are submerged in it, you look up and see the reflections of trees and colorful buildings on the surface of the water. 

You only need to spend five minutes meditating on the river, this won't remove the dark cloud completely but it will get the ball rolling and prepare you for the next steps.  The dark cloud affects us all, and areas of high pressure move to areas of low pressure; so at first you will meditate and clear your surroundings, but other dark clouds will move in to fill the gap. You can't "cure" the dark cloud in a day, but you can have TREMENDOUS RELEIF. 

We would like everyone on all sides to join us & help get rid of the dark cloud.  If you start to feel that darkness creeping back in, you can meditate on the Drave to start destroying it.  The dark cloud is ENOURMOUS -- litterally the size of a cloud,  meditation can be exhausting. It will keep coming for a time, as other dark clouds move in to fill the gap.   We have to work a little harder to get rid of them, but ther are only a couple more steps.  For now, lets take a step back and go over a few other things. 


# Ghosts vs Deities: know what you are
Trying to explain the difference between a ghost and a deity is like trying to explain the difference between a dog and a wolf. After meeting and working with you through out the years, I've discovered that some deities identify as ghosts.  Not only do they identify as ghosts, but they can't tell the difference between ghosts and deities.  This is a HUGE problem because we need deities to save us from the ghosts, but if they think they're a ghost they aren't going to be very receptive.

2nd problem with deities that think they are ghosts: the dark cloud and ghosts can be eliminated in cemetaries, yet deities are immune. This is crucial to understand because it is one of our major tactics.  Unfortunately, some deities are afraid, superstitious of cemetaries. 

So how do you _really_ know what you are? Put simply: deities are self-reliant, they take matters into their own hands.  People often come to you for help and you take it upon yourself to assist.  But the big, scary test is that you can walk into a cemetary and walk back out again. You can also check the appendix section on Ghosts vs Deities to see my attempt at differentiating between your kinds.  


# Cemetaries and the Dark Cloud
# The why - unholy energy vs holy ground
    - non-denominational
    - the good the bad the ugly, the christians the wiccans the hindu, the scientologies
We are really counting on the superbeings that can travel to the Drave in person, but we can't guarentee they will help us.  This next step is for all spiritual entities who can't visit the Drave, you have another option to eliminate the dark cloud. Just like taking a dip in the Drave, going to the cemetary cleanses the dark cloud's sticky spiritual energy off your spiritual body allowing for clearer thoughts and more focus. 

The thing about the Drava river is that it is almost instantaneous, as soon as you see it this cloud of nasty energy just drains off of you -- visiting the cemetary doesn't work as fast.  But if you spend a whole hour in the cemetary you should come out feeling better than you've felt in years, like a weight lifted off your shoulders. Just TRY IT. 

Go to the last cemetary you remember, put your hands on a tree in the cemetary.  The tree is IMPORTANT because it accelerates the process. Just being in a cemetary doesn't cut it.  Then you need to stay there for at least 20 mintutes, but an hour if you can.  We recommend repeating this process daily, having "a shower" will clear your mind, sharpen your focus and prepare you for the daily battles ahead.  

Once you've been to the cemetary in person, you can also meditate on it to clear the dark cloud from your home. Take a mental photograph of a cemetary tree surrounded by headstones so that you can meditate on it at will.  I wish this process was as short and sweet as the Drave but it takes a while.  If you can work towards or commit to an hour of meditation in your home, simply envisioning the cemetary around you, you will feel an absence of friction and the dark cloud being drained away. 

The only caveot is that the dark cloud _litterally_ comes from above, specifically above the roof.  You can meditate in your home for quite some time, as the dark cloud's energy field drains, you may notice that its coming directly from your human's head.  They may feel some pressure on the top of their head, this is because the dark cloud doesn't live in your house, it lives _over_ your house. It comes down through the roof in an energtic tunnel we call a "tentacle". 

Meditating on the cemetary on the roof will be the most valuable.  Stay close to your human and make sure your medidation is centered around a tree.  But, even if you don't get it perfect it works. Start with yourself first, all you need to do is imagine yourself in a cemetary touching a tree and it still works.  Or you can just imagine a cemetary and it still works.

We're claiming that there are unholy forces attacking us and it can be defended with holy ground, and maybe a few other tips and tricks.  But at the end of the day we are aiming to defeat unholy, malicious forces with holy ground -- in this case the cemetary.  We choose cemetaries because they are neutral, spiritual deadzones, common and accessable to all.  We do not want to dance on religious lines, we want all of you from any walk of life to help us fight this spiritual war. 

All religions are seeking the path to God, regardless of your religion we all share unholy enemies. United we can change the world, and we can each continue to pursue our religious beliefs. Not to exclude athiests or agnostics, if they're willing we need their help too. 


# Team Building 
The cemetary exercise is time-consuming, but it is also going to be the most common option for deities that can not visit the Drave.  For both the Drave and the cemetary excercises, you can magnify the effects and expidite the results if you create teams, force multiply and meditate in unison. Teach this to as many people as possible and form TEAMS. BIG ONES. Its easy once you get started.

For all parties, its good enough if you just want to meditate on the Drave or the cemetary, but if you want to go pro then start by visiting the Drave or the cemetary, go back home and meditate on the Drave or the cemetary, and when you think you're done or just tuckered out, go back to the Drave or the cemetary again. Making in-person visits help with the fatigue that meditating for extended periods can cause. 

The first goal is to secure your home and remove the dark cloud from your surroundings.  It takes time if you can not visit the Drave, but it is worth it.  Being in the cemetary should give you a sense of peace and calm, a total lack of spiritual friction.  Your home could be just as peaceful if you can keep going. 

The end goal is to improve your well being so that you can stand with us and fight.  The process feels like an emotional roller coaster, but if you've followed our instructions so far, its already over. 


# Ghosts, Possesion and their Shadow Society 
What if your loved ones aren't _completely_ your loved ones, but a collection of personality traits from different entities fighting for control of them?  What if your loved ones barely express themselves at all, competing for their body and mind and failing most of the time?  What if instead of haunted houses, we have haunted people? And they are haunted by a plethora of ghosts all competing for control? 

What if those ghosts are angry, difficult, shallow, spiteful... what if they are everywhere? What if they took over completely?

The spiritual world is overpopulated with a variety of entities, your human's spirit "team" is comprised of deities such as yourself, and ghosts -- human souls who have skipped out on judgement.  The way a ghost avoids the afterlife is by simply avoiding cemetaries or other holy ground.  Considering that all spiritual entities are invisible, I am spitballing that ghosts outnumber deities 30 to 1. 

Ghosts are the easiest of all to get rid of. But why would you? 

Houses aren't haunted, people are haunted.  In extreme situations, ghosts are taking hostages, turning extroversion into introversion, like a sort of paranoid schizophrenia or extreme social anxiety.  They whisper negative thougts in their minds, tell them their loved ones and their colleagues are conspiring against them, that the birds and the squirrels are watching them. They taunt them about their memories and their daily experiences, they are the reason that your humans lay down in bed at night and can't sleep because suddenly they've got a movie of every mistake or bad experience they've ever had playing in their head. In some caseses ghosts are possessive and will literally hold humans hostage in their own homes, preventing them from leaving the premises. They also fight each other for control of your humans, and will punish your humans if they aren't able to possess them successfully. 

Those are just ghosts residing with you. 

Ghosts are aweful and they're everywhere, I can't speak for every ghost out there, but they are generally jerks or Karens.  We're talking about entities that are refusing to cross over, maybe they made a few mistakes or maybe they've been assholes their whole life, and continue to be assholes in this one.  Either way, they fear judgement and they shouldn't be haunting people let alone taking hostages. Its like someone cheated death and taught everyone and their mom how to do it.  At best, they are like the helicopter parents of the afterlife, but all sorts of ghosts from all sorts of places can engage with your humans, most of which are working to undermine them for the sake some other person's spirit team.  

Aside from the worst case scenarios, ghosts form a sort of shadow society.  They want to own your human. There are enough of them that have so much control over their human hosts that they litterally live for them, whether the host likes it or not. I'm talking about posssession, possesion so subtle that it could seem like a form of cohabitation.  Their activities are indecernable from other human activities.  The modern ghost isn't going to sit around and haunt your house, they are going to bounce between your human and their other hosts while they work, raise their family, spend time with their friends, and even join them during your religious practices. They hear through your humans, see through your humans and speak through your humans. 

This may sound similar to how yourself, a deity, behaves, but deities aren't generally so possessive.  You step in to help at times and move around quite a bit.  As opposed to _owning_ a person, family or business, your kind ushers human beings through life and its challenges.  Deities are very helpful, many deities are at the wrong end of a choke chain by ghosts -- _and can't even tell A GHOST is holding the leash._  Ghosts are arrogant, lazy and intimidating and they cause mayhem when they don't get what they want.  They cause mayhem even when they are getting what they want. All you have to do is nothing and they will antagnoize you for life.  They have taken the karma concept to new levels, they think they are invincible and tend to harrass others into serving them.

Think of a massively multiplayer online game where the players compete for human resources and retaliate if they can not control a host. 


# Round 2: Ghosts
We've been misled, ghosts don't come _from_ cemetaries, they are supposed to go _to_ cemetaries. Cemetaries themselves are spiritual deadzones, the only beings that can survive them are living creatures or deities. That creepy, surreal silence that spooks you when you've been through a cemetary?  It is just the absense of most forms of spiritual life, in world overpopulated by spiritual activity.  Though some deities do like to have some fun with us if we wander through; typically deities on your own spirit team. 

Okay, now for the fun stuff. _How_ do we get rid of ghosts? 

Well, we can't force them to go to the cemetary, but we can bring the cemetary to the ghosts.  Like the dark cloud, ghosts inhabit your usual surroundings and the effect of cemetaries on ghosts is almost instantaneous. If you are at home, all you need to do is momentarily envision a cemetary overlaid onto your human's surroundings.  Take a close up picture in you mind of a cemetary, envision the trees and the headstones as far as the eye can see. You can also join your human at work and envision a cemetary expanding accross the entire office or job site. Clearly, this is meant to eliminate medling ghosts from other human's spirit teams.  The same concept applies to your friends and family.

Also like the dark cloud, initially you can eliminate ghosts from your surroundings, but other ghosts will move in to fill the gap. So you may have to repeat the process frequently over the next few days or weeks.  You want to follow your human to all of their usual environments and imagine the cemetary everywhere they go.  Ghosts are generally responsible for voices and nagging thoughts -- what you can expect after imagining the cemetary is mental peace, calm and quiet.  Deities can do the same things as ghosts -- nagging, antagonizing, making them relive prior memories in their imagination. Frankly, if a deity is doing it there isn't much you can do about it, but usually its coming from ghosts. 

Think about the top 5 people in your life that drive you crazy.  People who are always wanting something from you, always nagging you, always degrading you.  These people have a high probablility of being possessed by ghosts. Go to them and imagine the cemetary around them. Center the tree over your human, in some cases you will see a big smile emerge on their faces. It takes seconds to eradicate ghosts, and the joy that your humans experiece will be very gratifying. 


# Feel better _right now_ 
Earlier I mentioned that one of our goals is to make you feel better.  Why?  Well first of all, we just want you to feel better. You're one of us and we've been there. You don't only deserve to feel better, you _have_ to feel better to help us unfuck this.  We _need_ your help.  Cleaning up this mess is punishment enough as it is. 

Second of all, we're really not trying to take anyone's pain away. Sometimes when you feel bad you just need to feel it somehow, and it can be offensive to run into a bunch of people telling you "just don't feel bad."  But hear us out, we think the dark cloud is responsible for _making_ you feel bad; moreso than you would on your own.  A few of the symptoms of being surrounded by the dark cloud are irritability, angst, dispair and in many cases spiritual violence. 

What we want to do is elimate the dark cloud and isolate you so that you know your feelings are your own.  So that we know there isn't some puppet master in the clouds flipping switches in your head, trying keep you down.  If you aren't feeling your best, pop over to the cemetary. It takes around an hour, but the dark cloud can't survive the cemetary, so though it may be attached to you, possibly manipulating you, you can trust that your feelings are your own in the cemetary. The point is, sure you've made mistakes, and life is hard, but the dark cloud is taking those negative feelings and amplifying them so much they consume you. 

Here's the test, if you trusted us when we told you to go to the cemetary, you can use that to check your emotions.  Cemetaries are spiritual deadzones, and the dark cloud can't follow you in without being absorbed by the cemetary.  So if you don't feel your best, go to the cemetary and let it all out there. We're betting that some of those feelings are being masterminded by the dark cloud. 

If you really have to, don't kick yourself just yet, save it for later because we've got to get you through the next few pages, where more of the fun stuff is.  But _how_ do we make you feel better? 


# You are supernatural beings with supernatural needs
When we feel drained, we've found that we can also supplement ourselves directly through our surroundings or indirectly through meditation.  We are supernatural beings with supernatural needs, what is best for the human body isn't enough for us. 

Some may call this "energy vampires", but I disagree. Your kind has the ability to pull nutrients from your surroundings, it is so natural you don't even have to think about it.  So if you are "malnurished", or feeling drained you are naturally going to absorb nurishment from your surroundings, including your humans.  Its imperitive that your humans take daily multi-vitamins at minimum. 

Proactively surrouding yourself with nutritious sources will improve your comfort and mood considerably.  Please take some time out of your day and travel to the following places, spend 5 minutes in each place: 

 1. Produce section at the grocery store
 2. Spice section at the grocery store 
 3. The tea section at the grocery store
 4. Vitamin Shoppe or GNC
 5. Biggest crystal store you know 
 6. The pharmacy at CVS, Walgreens or Walmart
 7. The Periodic Table of Elements - insert table 

If you are unable or unwilling to go directly, you can also envision yourself in each of these places for a moderate energy boost. Try imagining yourself in the produce section at a grocery store, walk through the aisles slowly, take in all of the oranges, grapefruit and apples, the cabbage, lettuce, leeks, carrots, black berries and blue berries, just envision yourself absorbing these things.  
 
Go over to the spice section, stand in front of it and just take it all in.  If it feels good to you, keep going! Just imagine yourself slowly walking down the aisles of each place above. 

# Audience / Deities - dedicated to 
    - We have to convince these people they are deities and there is a way to help people that doesn't mean breaking their backs 
    - they're bending over backwards trying to make people happy and fix the problem but they aren't doing anything about the real problem because they don't know what the real problem is
So far, we have begun to tackle the dark cloud, eliminated ghosts and provided options for you to nurish yourselves.  While the dark cloud exercise may take weeks depending on the size of your spirit team, the ghosts are eliminated instantly.  You're whats left.  This book is written to you and your human conterparts, if you are still reading by now you are what I consider a deity. 

Seems like an odd time to write a section on my target audience, but the dark cloud and ghosts are sentient and manipulative.  I wanted to ensure you were able to keep reading while taking out any interference. Ghosts have many of the same abilities as deities, such as detering or redirecting human attention spans. Opening with the intention of culling the herd would have only warned them that they needed to close the book.  Luckily, both the dark cloud and ghosts are extremely arrogant, we may be the first people who ever posed a threat. 

Deities are extremely supportive, often bending over backwards to assist their human counterparts.  You lend yourself to cleaning up messes, either litteral or otherwise. Your love is unconditional and you strive to support your humans with their day to day challenges.  The exercises presented in this guide are the most valuable things you can do for both yourself, your humans and the world.

You are overworking yourselves taking care of afflicted people when you could be treating the cause. You are a deity with skills and abilities that are unfathomable to humans, and human kind has been conquered by malicious spiritual forces.  You are the only ones that can fight this.  We need you to step out of your routine, come up for air, and use the exercises in this guide to support yourself and your humans.  We need you to make allegiances with other deities and work together to eradicate the spiritual threats we are all facing.  


# Round 3: The Dark Cloud's Core
Earlier we taught you how to take chunks out of the dark cloud.  If you can't go to the Drave it may take days or weeks, but if you are diligent you should be able to eradicate its spiritual field -- the cloud-like spiritual smog. You can liken this spiritual field with depression, so destroying it can alieve feelings of lethargy and dispair.  

The dark cloud has 4 aspects, its smog-like spiritual field, a tentacle that you can occasionally feel, and some sort of nucleus at the center of its consciousness.  Its final trait is that some of its spiritual-smog can stick to you, well I should say that a lot of it will stick to you. This substance can be anywhere, its not as extreme as if you, say one day decided to run through a dark cloud, but after you clear the dark cloud there will probably still be some left and you also may encounter it when you leave your home to go about your day. 

The majority of people are just drowning in the dark cloud's spiritual field, but the dark cloud's tentacle can also attach itself to humans.  The tentacle always feels like its coming from above you, and it usually sits right above the brainstem.  If the dark cloud has a tentacle in your human, you may notice that it seems to be oozing some sort of spiritual energy.  That is the source of the spiritual smog, the dark cloud's spiritual field. 

So how to get rid of it?  In reality, both the ghosts and the dark cloud are vulnerable to cemetaries.  Meditating on the Drave can drain much of the dark cloud's spiritual field but it can't eliminate the core of the dark cloud, its nucleus and tentacle.  You can meditate on the cemetary to eliminate it; it is very important that you envision a tree in the cemetary covering your human, you can also _reach into_ your human's head and grab the tail of the tentacle while you meditate.  

This process works, but it is very time-consuming.  It might take days or weeks if you are doing it by yourself. 

I wrote this book to eliminate the dark cloud as quickly as possible, before it can realize what is happening. You may have noticed that initially I didn't give you much context on why you should visit the Drave or what the dark cloud is.  I didn't want it to understand that we were going to destroy it, I just wanted you to get to the Drave or the cemetary as quickly as possible.  It can also see through your human and hear through your human, but initially, its too slow to realize we're talking about it, and otherwise its too arrogant to believe we can annihilate it.  

If the dark cloud has a tentacle in your human, it can become violent if it realizes that you intend to destroy it.  You may experience strange and painful sensations, especially when you are sitting still for extended periods.  It can move from the brainstem into the chest, where it can cause tightness and severe chest pain.  If this happens, you can reach into your human's body, where the pain is, and grab the "tail" of the tentacle, which eases the pain.  Then you can meditate on the cemetary to slowly drain it away. 

If the dark cloud gets to the point where it is causing chest pain, you can use a trick to proove that the pain is spiritual in nature.  The dark cloud is _incredibly_ slow, its biggest advantage is it size. If it gets down to just the core and the tentacle, you may notice that you are only feeling discomfort when you are sitting or standing still.  Stand up and consider the sensations in your body, you may feel pressure on your head or in your chest.  Now _quickly_ take a big side step, you will notice that the discomfort is momentarily gone.  Now if you stay still, you should start to feel a pressure on top of your head coming from the direction you were standing.  Stay still and consider the sensation of the dark cloud "catching" you again. 

At home, you can't outrun the dark cloud.  It will follow you to every room and may even feel more extreme outside, where there is no roof between you and the dark cloud.  But it tends to hover in the same vicinity, such as your home. So say if you went out and did some errands, went to the gym, things like that, you will feel relief as long as you don't encounter other dark clouds.  But all that is meaningless if you go home and are suddenly uncomfortable, lethargic and gloomy.

You have to destroy it via meditating on the Drave and the cemetary.  Its the only way we know of.  It takes a while, but what is a few weeks compared to a few years?  The peace, satisfaction and freedom you and your human will feel after the dark cloud's elimination is indescribable. 


# Torture Prevention 
Most humans in pain are afflicted by spriritual forces, microaggressions or flat out attacks.  If your humans are in pain, _assume_ that the source is spiritual and just try feeling around for it.  Typically, the more intense the pain, the more likely that it is orchestrated.  You don't need a team for this, you can perform this on your own. 

The feeling of being tortured amounts to a spirtual form generating a high energy beam that is horribly painful to humans. This can originate from deities, ghosts, spheres and the dark cloud.  It can occur anywhere in your body, all four forms of beings are essentially relying on the same technique, its akin to someone playing a video game and pressing the X button over and over again.  There isn't much tactical variety, but the pain manifests in: 

- migraines
- earaches 
- sore throats 
- chest pain / tension 
- upset stomach 
- IBS 
- vaginal cramps 
- flatulence 
- diareah 

Torture prevention is easy for deities.  You can do something about it, you don't have to stand by and feel helpless.  The beauty of the power that is weilded agaist humans is that it doesn't hurt you at all.  Energy is transferable, all you need to do is _reach in_ and touch the painful area.  I'm under the impression that you get a breif high off of it, like taking a drag off a cigarette when you haven't smoked in a while. 

We want you to assume the source is spiritual because it will inspire you to investigate the pain and confirm that it is or is not spiritual in nature.  Investigate all forms of pain, you may find the majority of it is spiritual.  


# Example: Headache - If the Pain Moves
A great way to get started is with migraines, they're fairly common and we've found the majority of these to be spiritual in nature, usually caused by spheres.  You can ease much of the world's suffering if all you did was get good at "healing" migraines.  Sphere's are generally the cause of migraines, again this is really easy for your kind to treat. 

You are in for a surprise the first time you try it, like above, all you have to do is reach in and touch the painful area.  What you may find is that the pain may _litterally move_ once you start feeling around for it.  This is a huge indicator that the migraine is spiritual.  It doesn't move very quickly, they can be fun to catch.  When you try to touch a sphere, I like to say you can pop it, but thats not really accurate.  Its more like the ball of energy gets drained away quickly.  But you have to chase it until its gone completely.  Luckily, it won't try to escape the body, though it may move around quite a bit until its gone. 

I don't talk about spheres much because they are so easy to get rid of, but they are a constant source of pain for their targets.   To the best of our knowledge, once they are "popped" they are gone for good, and they can't hurt your person or anyone else ever again.  Someone who has a lot of migraines might have a lot of spheres, so as with the other processes you may have to repeat the exercise a few times.  The bigger the sphere the more pain it can cause. Anywhere it goes. 

Of course, you can get started with pain in any area of the body and we encourage you to do so.  


# Insomnia / Sleep Deprivation 
Ghosts and deities can cause insomnia or sleep deprivation.  This can be as bad as total sleep deprivation, several attacks in the middle of the night, or occasionally waking up at any hour and struggling to go back to bed.  Of course, some of this is natural, so those that only wake up occasionally are less likely to be afflicted.  

We don't have a solution for this aside from eradicating ghosts to lessen the problem.  Its frankly embarassing that deities partake in this tactic, but it is true. If you have been struggling to sleep, meditating on the cemetary should lessen the problem, by eliminating ghosts. But if a deity is waking you in the night we don't have a solution, aside from praying.  Asking them nicely to stop.  

In rare cases, you can reason with them.  Some deities attempt to wake you up early for productivity, irregardless of when you went to bed the prior night.  You may be able to explain your lifestyle, including the time you need to be in at work and the time you get off.  You may be able to explain that you have roommates and you can't acheive anything in the morning without waking someone or being disruptive. 

Some deities do not believe that humans need 8 hours of sleep, and will continually short your time resting. You may be able to share facts with them, such as a well rested human is more dedicated and ambitious, more creative and outgoing, more willing to be active throughout the day, and more social. As where a sleep deprived human is more prone to pleasure seeking activity such as, MORE SLEEP, over eating, drinking alchohol, substance abuse, companionship, caffinated drinks, etc. 

Through experience, we admit this is a long shot. Sleep deprivation is one of the worst tactics deities use outside of smiting -- capable of crippling someone for life. In some cases that is the goal.  The only way you can appeal to them is if they want you to succeed. 


# Types of Entities and How They Hurt
Throughout my spiritual experiences I have encountered a variety of entities, most of which are harmful.  We're all familiar with dieties and ghosts, either from legend or personal experience, but there are a few more unique entities that you may encounter more frequently. 

Any entity you encounter inflicts pain with just plain electricity, there is no magic about it aside from their ability to summon it on a whim.  The exception to this is the dark cloud's energy field, I wouldn't describe it as energy measured in the form of positive and negative, but we don't have the vernacular to define it acurately.  "Spiritual smog" is the term that is the most accurate so far, but in the future we may understand more about this entity and clarify its definition. 

The most basic description of electricity is that there are positive and negative charges, the only thing you need to know is that positive charges cause significant pain where ever it targets you.  We have 6 entities we can recognize and define, all six of them are using the same tactic to cause pain and discomfort. 

The Dark Cloud - The dark cloud casts a wide net and will generally ignore you unless you are a person of power or influence, or a threat, then you may have other sensations such as the tentacle feeling or chest tightness or pain.  This is a beam of positive energy that causes pain like the others.  Though the dark cloud doesn't cause as much pain as other entities do, I can not emphasize enough that it is our worst enemy.  It takes humans, ghosts and deities hostage, manipulating their thoughts, words, behaviors and actions.

The dark cloud creates sensations of lethargy, dispair, irritability, irrationality, discord and friction.  These sensations affect humans, ghosts and deities, and drive wedges between anyone and everything.  Aside from chest pain, living within the boundries of a dark cloud creates feelings of pressure, like wearing a weighted blanket every day or feeling like your head is caving in. 

Spheres - We chose this word because Orbs were already taken, there are plenty of YouTube videos on Orbs, essentially any glowing spherical object.  I have never encountered an Orb but I believe they are highly dangerous. What I'm defining as spheres are not visible to the human eye.  They are between the size of marbles and golf balls and they cause pain where ever they touch you, such as giving you headaches if they are in your head or giving you cramps if they are in your abdomin. 

Spheres with spikes - Similar to spheres but even more aggressive.  They give the sensation of something spinning very quickly, like a ball of barbed wire in your head. 

Sparkler - This does not seem to be a sentient entity at all.   It doesn't respond when you talk about it, or seem to intensify its aggression.  It is a term for a feeling that starts from the brain stem and sort of sparks outward.  Deities will have to be very observant to detect them, but they cause intense confusion and disorientation.  You can tell its there if the roof of your human's mouth is tingling.  Your human will probably not be able to describe what is happening to them, they may even zone out or shake their heads as if they were trying to free themselves.  Like every other spiritual entity, all you need to do is reach in and grab it.  Shouldn't take more than a few minutes, and it doesn't move around.  

Ghosts - If your human is hearing voices, its likely a ghost or ghosts. Deities can speak to humans, but they are much more cautious.  Whereas a ghost is likely speaking to your human in order to deride or demean them. The advanced ones are able to do this from the moment someone wakes up, to the moment they go to bed -- they'll be lucky if they let them sleep. 

Ghosts can be all over the board, just like any human.  The ones that cause the most trouble can coordinate amongst themselves and strategize to cause suffering.  This includes taking turns antagonizing humans verbally.  This may also include sleep deprivation, and ghosts may coordinate amongst each other to wake your human at any hour of the night.

They are intelligent, but the worst ones are more like a gang of 14y old boys playing Call of Duty. They are not powerful on their own, but they can team up and coordinate attacks.  Together, they can generate enough power that it compares to smiting.  Do not forget, they are the easiest to kill.  Even a human, on their own can eradicate them.  All they have to do is imagine being in a cemetary.  

Deities - Smiting 
I define deity as any ghost-like spiritual form that can survive a cemetary, but some of them are far more powerful than others. If you draw their wrath they are unstoppable.  Deities are all equipped to inflict a considerable amount of pain, usually manifesting as seizures or what I would call smiting -- an energy beam hitting you like a lightning bolt that can be sustained for hours. It can be slow and deliberate as well, precision targeting any area of your body. Luckily, deities are a lot harder to provoke than any other spiritual entity.

You can treat smiting the same way as you treat other attacks, just by reaching in and touching it, but you have to be persistant.  These attacks can last days or weeks. If you have the option to visit a behavioral health center, take advantage of this, as medication can treat psychopathic deities just as it can treat psychopathic humans.  The good part is that the most violent deities tend to be aflicted by the dark cloud, so eliminating the dark cloud may make them more peaceful. 


Deities - Ambient Electricity  
While generally well meaning, deities have a problem with what feels like static electricity.  Its a very small, localized energy field but it doesn't come from deities, it seems to be attacted to them the way that positive and negative energy attract.  Let's say that a spiritual deity is negatively charged, positively charged electricity is attracted to their spiritual body. This is fine for them, but if they happen to visit you you may feel a tingling sensation that ranges from pleasent to incredibly disorienating.  In extreme cases it can cause brain fog, diorientation, confusion.  It may cause you to shake or tremble, and the effect is amplified if you have a few deities hanging out with you, working, raising a family, helping friends and relatives.

The good part is, the deities themselves can remove this static electricity through a few of the means that we've already gone over. The easiset way is called "grounding", they can simply go outside and touch a tree for a few minutes.  Nothing special, no traveling to Europe or creepy cemetaries, its not really a spiritual problem compared to the rest of the problems we have discussed so far.  Deities are just attracting positive electricity from their homes, _your homes_, and they need a way to drain the energy for everyone's benefit. 

The entire earth is negatively charged, which absorbs positive electricity.  I emphasize touching a tree because it seems to work much faster than say, taking a walk in the grass.  They can also meditate on the Drave or the cemetary to drain the positive energy, again its not really spiritual its just that the entire earth is able to mitigate excessive electricity.


# A Tangled Web 
Eliminating spiritual interferance from your home should create a feeling of peace and comfort in your living space.  Then you will only need to maintain it, though every interaction you or your human have with others can attract the attention of other spiritual beings.  The world is so over-populated with spiritual forces that you'll have to keep beating it back, but it becomes easier once you've cleared your first zone.  Clearing a zone just means eliminating ghosts and the dark cloud from your surroundings, and poking around in your human's head regularily to make sure there's nothing there that shouldn't be.  Ideally, you'll also be teaching our methods to any deity that's left. 

Once you've cleared a zone you may become _much_ more sensitive to spiritual presence, now that you understand what the absense of spiritual forces feels like. Allow me to paint a picture; you have a house with three roommates, each of these roommates had a spirit "team" made up of yourself, ghosts, other deities and the dark cloud.  Some of these ghosts and deities may identify as friends, family or colleagues.  Other malicious spirits were interloping with the dark cloud, but you got together with the other deities and cleared the zone, eliminated the dark cloud and the ghosts, now its just you and your humans.  Lets just assume that we created a safe space.

One of your humans works from home, they have video calls regularily with clients and colleages.  Each of these clients and colleages has a spirit team of the same composition, and when they have meetings, a combination of the dark cloud, ghosts and deities rotate through your home. Why?  Its just what they do. You can't be all seeing and all knowing if you are a spiritual being that can go anywhere but decides not to.  This influx of spriritual activity may be transient, but mostly due to the dark cloud, it just feels awful.  These beings may also decide to stick around for a while.

Your other human works downtown at a resturant.  The resturant's employees all have their own spirit team and the resturant's owner also has a spirit team.  Even the resturant's guests have their own spirit teams. The owner's spirit team constantly rotates through their employee's homes for no reason other than being nosy.  Some of the employee's spirit team also visit each other, also just being nosy, though some of them may be friends.  Even a guest's spirit team may get nosy and start poking around in your home. 

One of your human's has a child that goes to elementary school, they have spirit teams comprised of their family, friends, and even teachers -- and so does every other child at the school.  As they make friends and enimies throughout their childhood, these spirits rotate around through the homes and lives of their friends and enemies, helping and hurting depending on their relationship. 

Your last human is a realator. They don't engage with many people aside from their roommates, their family and the occasional client.  But they go to the grocery store, the gym, and takes odd-jobs here and there.  This individual is incredibly attractive, and draws attention everywhere they go.  They encounter spirits throughout their day, some of which become attached and could even "adopt" the realator as one of their own -- interfering with the realator's spirit team. 

Why would all of these spiritual entities do this?  The dark cloud just wants to spread, but ghosts are all over the board. Maybe they like your human, maybe they don't like your human.  Maybe they like your dog, maybe they don't like your dog.  You could be doing very well at work and they simply want to undermine you for their own human's benefit. I'm biased against most spiritual forms, but ghosts are the biggest nuisance, especially between coworkers.  Justifying their intent or actions is impossible from a human perspective.  The simpilest answer could be, because they can.  Ghosts especially are controlling, judgemental, immature and petty.   The worst of them are _very_ immature and form gangs to terrorize people for fun. 

The point is, we are outnumbered and any exchange between any other individual may attract spiritual attention. There is no rhyme or reason for their behavior, most of them really enjoy picking on people.  Sowing discord, starting fights, whispering negative thoughts in your head, in some cases screaming them.  Hurting your humans in any part of their bodies.  Its not hopeless, and we want you to go out from you cleared zone and continue eliminating them. 

I have an enourmous amount of faith in the dedication and determination of deities, once you've "cleared a zone" as we call it, a zone such as your home, you might just start to like it enough that you go looking for trouble.  


# Homework
Homeless people are severly afflicted by extreme spiritual forces, such as the dark cloud, ghosts and spheres.  Don't take my word for it, go find one.  When you first encounter them, you may feel that weighted blanket sensation that I've defined as indicative of the dark cloud.  When you listen to their heads you may hear voices that aren't thier own.  Their dark clouds may be bigger than anything you've encountered so far, you'll need a team to clear it.  The voices on the other hand are probably ghosts, and you can quickly eliminate them by meditating on the cemetary in the homeless person's vicinity. 

- Of course, homeless people may have a lot of other problems 
- these dark clouds are not just targeting homeless people, the homeless people are caught in their webs 
- THey are like honey pots, eliminating the dark clouds from homeless people can help anyone in a 5 mile radius 
- They are like hot spots for spiritual activity
