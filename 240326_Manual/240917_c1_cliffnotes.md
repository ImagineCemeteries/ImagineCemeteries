# Disclaimer
I realize that not all of you can travel to far off places, the Drava River section is dedicated to those who can. Where they go, the dark cloud follows, and I'm sending them to a beautiful river that absorbs dark clouds. So they may take YOUR troubles with them to Europe, and leave them there. 

This will help you peripherally and the rest of this manual is useful to all of your kind. 


# Round 1: The Drave & the Dark Cloud
A dark cloud is not only hanging over your head, it is a sentient spiritual species. We gotta get rid of it and get you guys and gals feeling better.

Go to the Drava river. There are a variety of beautiful cities you can visit along the river, in four countries: Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia. Pick one of them from the list below and take a few minutes out of your day to swim in its waters. 

Toblach, Italy
Lienz, Austria
Oberdrauburg, Austria
Möllbrücke, Austria
Spittal an der Drau, Austria
Villach, Austria
Dravograd, Slovenia
Radlje ob Dravi, Slovenia
Maribor, Slovenia
Ptuj,Slovenia
Ormož, Slovenia
Varaždin, Croatia
Legrad, Croatia


# Shock / Whiplash 
We're proposing that spirits, ghosts, deities, demons, whatever you identify as, can be possessed the same way that humans can be.  And the dark cloud seems to be pulling the strings. 

This movement wasn't started, wasn't fought by saints.  We were just a bunch of people tangled up in this dark cloud, fighting each other over petty differences.  Then we realized there was something bigger than all of us, a common enemy, sabotaging us in everyway possible. Our relationships with each other, our goals, our mood.

After visiting the Drave, some of you, including most of us, will feel that a veil has been lifted.  A dark, evil veil.  You might be looking back on things and thinking, "what the fuck have I done?!"  Well, we're right there with you and we want you to join us.  We want you to want vengence. Vengence is eliminating the dark cloud.  

Once you get past the shock, you'll notice that you are stronger, faster, more perceptive.  Things come easier for you.  Help us make sure this never happens to anyone ever again. Keep reading and take the time you need, but don't stop here.  Don't punish yourself, just join us! 


# Now What? Meditation
We hope you feel better already but if you don't, don't worry, we're not done yet.  Buckle up! 

By going to the Drave, you have litterally taken a chunk out of the dark cloud and eliminated it.  The dark cloud is a sentient spiritual species and its contagious, in other words it will want to catch you again, even though it is weaker now that you've cleansed your energy.  

The dark cloud inhabits your surroundings the same way you and your humans inhabit your surroundings; you will eventually go back to where you came from, where the dark cloud is thriving.  The source of the dark cloud is probably in your usual environment, where you are sitting right now.  But, I'm willing to bet you are a lot better off than when we first started talking. You will feel better than you did before, but you might "catch" the dark cloud again from your surroundings. You can't take your whole environment to Austria, so now what? 

Here's the cool part.  If your regular terf, domicile, etc is still dripping in bad vibes,  in the same way you brought the dark cloud to the Drave, you can bring the Drave to the dark cloud. You can simply envision the river to remove the dark cloud from your surroundings.  You've been to the Drave. In your home, where you sit, imagine that you are surrounded by the river. You are submerged in it, you look up and see the reflections of trees and colorful buildings on the surface of the water. 

The dark cloud affects us all, and areas of high pressure move to areas of low pressure; so at first you will meditate and clear your surroundings, but other dark clouds will move in to fill the gap. You can't "cure" the dark cloud in a day, but you can have TREMENDOUS RELEIF. 

We would like everyone on all sides to join us & help get rid of the dark cloud.  If you start to feel that darkness creeping back in, you can meditate on the Drave to destroy it.  Because the dark cloud is ENOURMOUS, meditation can be exhausting. It will keep coming for a time, as other dark clouds move in to fill the gap.  Let it surround and absorb you, let it smother you then fall back to the Drave.  Eventually you will destroy the majority of it and you can meditate on any stragglers. 


# Ghosts vs Deities: know what you are
After meeting and working with you through out the years, I've discovered that some deities identify as ghosts.  This is a HUGE problem because we need deities to save us from the ghosts, but if they think they're a ghost they aren't going to be very receptive.

2nd problem with deities that think they are ghosts: ghosts can be eliminated in cemetaries, yet deities are immune. This is crucial to understand because it is one of our major tactics.  Unfortunately, some deities are afraid, superstitious of cemetaries. 

So how do you _really_ know what you are? I have a chapter dedicated to it, but put simply: deities are self-reliant, they take matters into their own hands.  People often come to you for help and you take it upon yourself to assist.  But the big, scary test is that you can walk into a cemetary and walk back out again. 


# Ghosts, Possesion and their Shadow Society 
What if your loved ones aren't _completely_ your loved ones, but a collection of personality traits from different entities fighting for control of them?  What if your loved ones barely express theirselves at all, competing for their body and mind and failing most of the time?  What if instead of haunted houses, we have haunted people? And they are haunted by a plethora of ghosts all competing for control? 

What if those ghosts are angry, difficult, shallow, spiteful... what if they are everywhere? What if they took over completely?

The spiritual world is overpopulated with a variety of entities, your human's spirit "team" is comprised of deities such as yourself, and ghosts -- human souls who have skipped out on judgement.  The way a ghost avoids the afterlife is by simply avoiding cemetaries or other holy ground.  Considering that all spiritual entities are invisible, I am spitballing that ghosts outnumber deities 30 to 1. 

Ghosts are the easiest of all to get rid of. But why would you? 

Houses aren't haunted, people are haunted.  In extreme situations, ghosts are taking hostages, turning extroversion into introversion, like a sort of paranoid schizophrenia or extreme social anxiety.  They whisper negative thougts in your mind, tell you your loved ones and your colleagues are conspiring against you, that the birds and the squirrels are watching you. They taunt you about your memories and your daily experiences, they are the reason that you lay down in bed at night and you can't sleep because suddenly you've got a movie of every mistake or bad experience you've ever had playing in your head. In some caseses they are possessive and will literally hold you hostage in your own home, preventing you from leaving the premises. They also fight each other for control of you, and will punish you if they aren't able to possess you successfully. 

Those are just ghosts residing with you. 

Ghosts are aweful and they're everywhere, I can't speak for every ghost out there, but they are generally jerks or Karens.  We're talking about entities that are refusing to cross over, its like someone cheated death and taught everyone and their mom how to do it.  At best, they are like the helicopter parents of the afterlife, but all sorts of ghosts from all sorts of places can engage with your human, most of which are working to undermine them for the sake some other person's spirit team.  

Aside from the worst case scenarios, ghosts form a sort of shadow society.  They want to own you. There are enough of them that have so much control over their human hosts that they litterally live for them, whether the host likes it or not. I'm talking about posssession, possesion so subtle that it could seem like a form of cohabitation.  Their activities are indecernable from other human activities.  The modern ghost isn't going to sit around and haunt your house, they are going to bounce between you and other hosts while you work, raise your family, spend time with your friends, and even join you during your religious practices. They hear through their humans, see through their humans and speak through their humans. 

Many deities are at the wrong end of a choke chain by ghosts.  Ghosts are arrogant, lazy and intimidating and they cause mayhem when they don't get what they want.  They cause mayhem even when they are getting what they want. All you have to do is nothing and they will antagnoize you for life.  They have taken the karma concept to new levels, they think they are invincible and tend to harrass others into serving them.

Think about the top 5 people in your life that drive you crazy.  People who are always wanting something from you, always nagging you, always degrading you.  These people have a high probablility of being possessed by ghosts. 

- If you free your humans they will be grateful that you have freed them even if they don't know who to be grateful to.  They may be happy, at least for a time.  It is a terrible thing to be posssessed for years... they may be happy at first but may also be sad for the time they have lost

# Round 2: Ghosts
We've been misled, ghosts don't come _from_ cemetaries, they are supposed to go _to_ cemetaries. Cemetaries themselves are spiritual deadzones, the only beings that can survive them are living creatures or deities. That creepy, surreal silence that spooks you when you've been through a cemetary?  It is just the absense of most forms of spiritual life, in world overpopulated by spiritual activity.  Though some deities do like to have some fun with us if we wander through; typically deities on your own spirit team. 

Okay, now for the fun stuff. How _do_ we get rid of ghosts? 

Well, we can't force them to go to the cemetary, but we can bring the cemetary to the ghosts.  Like the dark cloud, ghosts inhabit your usual surroundings and the effect of cemetaries on ghosts is almost instantaneous. If you are at home, all you need to do is momentarily envision a cemetary overlaid onto your human's surroundings.  Take a close up picture in you mind of a cemetary, envision the trees and the headstones as far as the eye can see. You can also join your human at work and envision a cemetary expanding accross the entire office or job site. Clearly, this is meant to eliminate medling ghosts from other human's spirit teams.  The same concept applies to your friends and family.

Also like the dark cloud, initially you can eliminate ghosts from your surroundings, but other ghosts will move in to fill the gap. So you may have to repeat the process frequently over the next few days or weeks.  You want to follow your human to all of their usual environments and imagine the cemetary everywhere they go.  Ghosts are generally responsible for voices and nagging thoughts.  What you can expect after imagining the cemetary is mental peace, calm and quiet.  Deities can do the same things as ghosts -- nagging, antagonizing, making you relive prior memories in your imagination. Frankly, if a deity is doing it there isn't much you can do about it, but usually its coming from ghosts. 


# Feel better _right now_ 
Earlier I mentioned that one of our goals is to make you feel better.  Why?  First of all, we just want you to feel better. You're one of us and we've been there. You don't only deserve to feel better, you _have_ to feel better to help us unfuck this.  We _need_ your help.  Cleaning up this mess is punishment enough as it is. 

Second of all, we're really not trying to take anyone's pain away. Sometimes when you feel bad you just need to feel it somehow, and it can be offensive to run into a bunch of people telling you "just don't feel bad."  But hear us out, we think the dark cloud is responsible for _making_ you feel bad; moreso than you would on your own.  A few of the symptoms of being surrounded by the dark cloud are irritability, angst, dispair and in many cases spiritual violence. 

What we want to do is elimate the dark cloud and isolate you so that you know your feelings are your own.  So that we know there isn't some puppet master in the clouds flipping switches in your head trying keep you down. Once we can remove the dark cloud, and you are _sure_ its gone, then take the time to feel your feels.  

If you really have to, don't kick yourself just yet, save it for later because we've got to get you through the next few pages, where more of the fun stuff is.  But _how_ do we make you feel better? 


# You are supernatural beings with supernatural needs
When we feel drained, we've found that we can also supplement ourselves directly through our surroundings or indirectly through meditation.  We are supernatural beings with supernatural needs, what is best for the human body isn't enough for us. 

Some may call this "energy vampires", but I disagree. Your kind has the ability to pull nutrients from your surroundings, it is so natural you don't even have to think about it.  So if you are "malnurished", or feeling drained you are naturally going to absorb nurishment from your surroundings, including your humans.  Its imperitive that your people take daily multi-vitamins at minimum. 

Proactively surrouding yourself with nutritious sources will improve your comfort and mood considerably.  Please take some time out of your day and travel to the following places, spend 5 minutes in each place: 

 1. Produce section at the grocery store
 2. Spice section at the grocery store 
 3. Vitamin Shoppe or GNC
 4. Biggest crystal store you know 
 5. The pharmacy at CVS, Walgreens or Walmart
 6. The Periodic Table of Elements - insert table 

If you are unable or unwilling to go directly, you can also envision yourself in each of these places for a moderate energy boost. Try imagining yourself in the produce section at a grocery store, walk through the aisles slowly, take in all of the oranges, grapefruit and apples, the cabbage, lettuce, leeks, carrots, black berries and blue berries, just envision yourself absorbing these things.  
 
Go over to the spice section, stand in front of it and just take it all in.  If it feels good to you, keep going! Just imagine yourself slowly walking down the aisles of each of the stores above. 


# Cemetaries and the Dark Cloud
In reality, both the ghosts and the dark cloud are vulnerable to cemetaries. Earlier I taught you how to take chunks out of the dark cloud. The dark cloud is comprised of three components that we can sense: 

    1. The dark cloud's spiritual field
        - This can be just as big as a cloud in the sky, this is what we are taking "chunks" out of.  We sometimes refer to this as "spiritual smog".  Before we discovered the Drave, eliminating the dark cloud was an endevour that took days, weeks, and even months. 
        - Typically, the dark cloud just catches you in its web and generally ignores you.
        - Getting caught in the dark cloud's web leads to lethargy and irritation.  I have speculated that spiritual smog could be the cause of depression. 
        - Its so big its impossible to escape.

    2. The dark cloud's tentacle 
        - The dark cloud has an infinite number of appendages that can feel like tentacles or ropes attached to those they have captured.  Generally these are attached to your head, right above the brain stem.  It always seems to come from above, directly above your head. 
        - It is not permanently attached to you, quick motions such as side stepping or going for a jog will release you from its grasp, but the dark cloud is incessant and pervasive and will catch up to you when you stop. 
        - water hose

    3. The dark cloud's nucleus 
        - I am not sure if this can be sensed by everyone, typically, the dark cloud just catches you in its web and generally ignores you. In my case, I was hell bent on destroying it, so during the last days it attacked me violently. 
        - To the best of my knowledge, after years of spiritual problems, the dark cloud can only cause chest pain. It does this by moving its tentacle from your head down into your chest and creating an energy that is close to a hot iron. The biggest threat that the dark cloud creates is lethargy and frustration, that you generally take out on your peers, friends and relatives. 
        - I can not emphasize enough that the dark cloud is both our biggest problem and our weakest enemy.  The problem is that they are enourmous, and though I have been reffering to a singular dark cloud, there are many, which often have ropes or attachments in the same humans. 


Now that you've been to the drave, the dark cloud is "naked", it is only comprised of its nucleus and its tentacle.  This is when the dark cloud becomes violent. You can expect chest pain 


# Where are we going with this? 
- you have to go to the cemetary to eliminate the core & tentacle of the dark cloud






This next step is for everyone, we can't all go to the Drave but you have another option to eliminate the dark cloud. Go to the last cemetary you remember, put your hands on a tree in the cemetary.  The tree is IMPORTANT. Just being in a cemetary doesn't cut it.  Then you need to stay there, for at least 20 mintutes but an hour if you can. 

The thing about the Drava river is that it is almost instantaneous, as soon as you see it this cloud of nasty energy just drains off of you. The cemetary process is a little different and takes longer than just going for a dip, but it is neccessary for everyone whether you can travel internationally or not. 

What I'm teaching you to do here is how to eliminate the dark cloud.  If you spend a whole hour in the cemetary you should come out feeling better than you've felt in years, like a weight lifted off your shoulders.  The end goal is to improve your well being so that you can stand with us and fight.  The process feels like an emotional roller coaster, but if you've followed our instructions its already over.  

# problem
Here's the test, if you trusted us when we told you to go to the cemetary, you can use that to check your emotions.  Cemetaries are spiritual deadzones, and the dark cloud can't follow you in without being absorbed by the cemetary.  So if you don't feel your best, go to the cemetary and let it all out there. We're betting that some of those feelings are being masterminded by the dark cloud. 

For some reason, if you visit the cemetary in person you come out feeling like a million dollars, but if you meditate on the cemetary you will feel drained. 

# Round 3: Eliminate the Dark Cloud 

- If you start to feel that darkness creeping back in, let it surround and absorb you, let it smother you then fall back to the Drave where possible, the cemetary otherwise.

Or if you are unable to visit the Drave, envision the cemetary:

    1. First you have to imagine a tree in a cemetary, the tree is IMPORTANT.

    2. Imagine the cemetary around the tree.  Expand as far as possible.
    
    3. Imagine the tree is actually covering your humans.

    * Even if you don't get it perfect it works. Start with yourself first, all you need to do is imagine yourself in a cemetary touching a tree and it still works.  Or you can just imagine a cemetary and it still works. 

    4. I wish this process was as short and sweet as the Drave but it takes a while.  If you can work towards or commit to an hour of meditation, simply envisioning the cemetary around you, you will feel an absence of friction and the dark cloud being drained away. 
    
    5. Teach this to as many people as possible and form TEAMS to meditate in unison.  BIG ONES. Its easy once you get started.

The dark cloud affects us all, and areas of high pressure move to areas of low pressure; so at first you will meditate and clear your surroundings, but other dark clouds will move in to fill the gap. You can't "cure" the dark cloud in a day, but you can have TREMENDOUS RELEIF. Imagine putting your hands on a tree in a cemetary and keep it there until you feel GREAT.  Do it again everytime you don't feel GREAT. 

We would like everyone on all sides to join us & help get rid of the dark cloud.  If you start to feel that darkness creeping back in, let it surround and absorb you, let it smother you then fall back to the Drave where possible, the cemetary otherwise.







# Our common enemies 
- Time for war: Dark Clouds, Ghosts, spheres and yarnballs
- 240902_dark_cloud.md
- Dark clouds are gigantic, litterally the size of clouds 
- There are many dark clouds, somehow separate from each other but overlapping 
- could be considered "spiritual smog"
- it is slow moving 
- It is contagious and spreads to the people in your surroundings 
- It mostly just surrounds you and tries to trap you in a spleepy brain fog 
- could be responsible for depression, can "catch" depression 
- It can take humans and deities hostage, manipulating their thoughts, words, behaviors and actions 
- It may have a nucleus that is sentient, but it is slow and stupid 
- cord cutting? 
- Like being possessed by a depressed, angry slug 

The majority of the dark cloud is made up of some sort of spiritual smog that dissolves when it comes into contact with a variety of things, especially cemetaries.

There are seven types of spiritual entities I have encountered, at least four of them are hostile to humans. Lets start with the dark cloud. 

deities - there are plenty of deities that know they are deities 
the dark cloud 
ghosts 
spheres
yarnball



# Torture Prevention
The feeling of being tortured essentially amounts to a spirtual form generating a high energy beam that is horribly painful to humans. This can originate from deities, ghosts, spheres and yarn balls.  It can occur anywhere in your body, all four forms of beings are essentially relying on the same technique, its akin to someone playing a video game and pressing the X button over and over again.  There isn't much tactical variety, but the pain manifests in: 

- headaches
- earaches 
- sore throats 
- chest pain / tension 
- upset stomach 
- IBS 
- vaginal cramps 
- flatulence 
- diareah 

Torture prevention is easy for deities. With any luck 


The first thing you need to know is that most humans in pain are afflicted by spriritual forces, microaggressions or flat out attacks.  If your humans are in pain, _assume_ that the source is spiritual and try the methods described here.  Typically, the more intense the pain, the more likely that it is orchestrated.

Now lets define the term orchestrated; to arrange or direct the elements of (a situation) to produce a desired effect, especially surreptitiously.

Now lets deifine the term surreptitiously; in a way that attempts to avoid notice or attention; secretively.

For some reason, the majority of these attacks are done in a way to make spiritual (and otherwise) onlookers believe that the source is medical in nature. They are hiding spiritual attacks in the form of common "illnesses."  Maybe even accentuating exsisting illnesses to make pain and discomfort unbearably extreme. 

If we have malicious forces attacking humans, why would they need to hide it?  What could possibly compel them to be so cunning? 


- disguising an attack as an illness, why? Because people won't try to fight it 

I believe they answer to a higher power as well, and their higher powers have been duped.  Well, if God is all seeing and all knowing, how could they possibly get away with it? Thats what we've been told of gods, maybe the one creater is all knowing and all seeing, but his decendants are more like you and I, falible to an extent. 

The forces antagonizing us may have reason to obscure their activities from middle deities.  Think of an ant yelling up to a human for help, to them we are all seeing and all knowing but we don't know the ants trials and afflictions. We have to show them that the pain that we're drowning in is contrived and proove it. 

Lets say these forces do answer to higher powers. 

I want you to assume the source is spiritual because it will inspire you to investigate the pain and confirm that it is or is not spiritual in nature.  Investigate all forms of pain, I think you will find the majority of it is spiritual. 



# audience 
- What is the worst pain you've experienced that wasn't from a violent event?  I'm not talking broken limbs or the dentist.  I'm talking about pain that is typically explained as headaches, cramps, IBS, chest pain. 



Torture is a strong word, using pain to manipulate and deter is popular. Punishment 

exhaustion, depression, anxiety, heartburn, headaches, cramps, shakes, and voices are all modern signs of spiritual microaggressions.


The first thing you need to know is that despite the variety of spiritual entities


# Deities
Deities are all equipped to inflict a considerable amount of pain, usually manifesting as seizures or what I would call smiting.  There is really nothing you can do to defend yourself outside of medications.  The good part is that the most violent deities tend to be aflicted by the dark cloud, so eliminating the dark cloud may make them more peaceful.
