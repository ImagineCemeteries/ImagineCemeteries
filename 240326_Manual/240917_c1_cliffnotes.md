# Disclaimer
I realize that not all of you can travel to far off places, the Drave section is dedicated to those who can. Where they go, the dark cloud follows, and I'm sending them to a beautiful river that absorbs dark clouds. So they may take YOUR troubles with them to Europe, and leave them there. 

This will help you peripherally and the rest of this manual is useful to all of your kind. 

# The Drave

A dark cloud is not only hanging over your head, it is a sentient spiritual species. 

Go to the Drava river. There are a variety of beautiful cities you can visit along the river, in four countries: Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia. Pick one of them from the list below and take a few minutes out of your day to swim in its waters. 

Toblach, Italy
Lienz, Austria
Oberdrauburg, Austria
Möllbrücke, Austria
Spittal an der Drau, Austria
Villach, Austria
Dravograd, Slovenia
Radlje ob Dravi, Slovenia
Maribor, Slovenia
Ptuj,Slovenia
Ormož, Slovenia
Varaždin, Croatia
Legrad, Croatia

# You are supernatural beings with supernatural needs. 

Some may call this "energy vampires", but I disagree. Your kind has the ability to pull nutrients from your surroundings, it is so natural you don't even have to think about it. 

Proactively surrouding yourself with nutritious sources will improve your comfort and mood considerably.  Please take some time out of your day and travel to the following places, spend 5 minutes in each place: 

 1. Produce section at the grocery store
 2. Spice section at the grocery store 
 3. Vitamin Shoppe or GNC
 4. Biggest crystal store you know 
 5. The pharmacy at CVS or Walgreens 
 6. The Periodic Table of Elements
