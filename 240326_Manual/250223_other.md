A book is a book. To write a book to you guys, I have to fill up the pages.  It is much simpler than this. You can get almost everything you need from the short list.  The rest of the book is valuable to _people and spirits that don't know us_. 

If you are already here, we'll tell you everything you need to know.  I want to write this book and publish it under a pen name so no one knows I wrote it.  I want to write this book for people that I will never meet, I don't want to meet every spirit in the world.  So the book is filled with things we talk about every day, things that the people who read it need to know.  Its not insider info or privillaged info, I'm just trying to spread this message without everyone showing up at my house.

It seems like everytime I start writing I get more pressure on me, if you are here to read over my shoulder I beg you to leave.  Come back M-F.  I only write the book on the weekends.  I will read it to you as much as you want when I'm done with it.  I have been working on the last sections for almost a month.  I can't handle the pressure of everyone converging on me.  I realize its quiet here but there are tons of people here already and I'm not going to be able to knock this out this month if everyone is hanging on my every word.
