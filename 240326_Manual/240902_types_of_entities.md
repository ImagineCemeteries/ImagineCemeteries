Ghost - most common.  Outnumbers deities at least 30 to 1, outnumbers humans 6 to 1. Highly vulnerable to cemetaries.  Just imagining a cemetary for a minute or so will eradicate all the ghosts. Nagging, wants to play god and be served. 

Deities - invulnerable to cemetaires, fire, brimstone, salt. "Angels" & "Demons" are in this category, they both share a love of fire. 

dark cloud - slow, stupid and arrogant. Lives in the "sky" but close to the ground.  Has a tentacle like appendage that comes down through the roof.  If left alone, it leaks aweful energy that builds up indoors. 
- also vulnerable to cemetaries but can't be destroyed instantly... Drave
- Is somewhat vulnerable to regular trees and grass, I think it hovers above the treeline so it is not absorbed by the earth
- Once it has you, you're unable to get out and its unable to let you go.  Which means you can take it to a cemetary to destroy it. 

bubble / rope / cord / String 
- The dark cloud will leak energy onces its attacted to you.  This can feel like a bubble in your head.  If left alone, the bubble can grow as big as a starbucks, or the perimeter of your home.  It starts to dissolve when it touches earth / grass / trees.  Very slowly. Most people have the starbucks version. "Sphere of influence" 

Spheres - spheres are typically the size of marbles or galf balls and cause pain.  Headaches, cramps, etc. They are vulnerable to deities, if you touch them they dissolve. It only takes a few minutes.  Anyone with a headache or cramps probably has a sphere.  Reach in and touch it, it will disolve
- they occassionally run and you have to chase them around the body but they are pretty slow

Yarn ball - spheres with spikes.  I don't have a good word for this yet.  Yarn balls are like spheres with chains, or long energetic barbs, they spin, litterally spin in your head & body and causes confusion and discomfort.  Generally very small, size of your head max. Can be disolved by touch. 

Orbs - honerable mention.   We choose to call the above spheres because orb was taken.  I have never encountered an orb but I saw them talking about it on YouTube.  Orbs appear to be incredibly dangerous!  Do not touch them like the spheres above. Avoid at all costs.
