Threw a dravite in a local river 

The Drava River flows through Austria as part of its 725 km journey from the Italian Alps to its confluence with the Danube in Croatia.  The Drava river runs through 4 countries (Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia), the source of Drava begins on Toblach Field, Toblach, Italy. It then continues through Austria, Slovenia, and finally Croatia.

A large section of the river runs through Carinthia, Austria. Then crosses the border to Slovenia at Vič, continuing through Slovenia from Dravograd past Radlje ob Dravi, Maribor and Ptuj, all the way to Ormož and Središče ob Dravi, where it crosses into Croatia after 145 km. 

The river continues its path towards Varaždin, where the river Mura, after 63 km at Legrad, converges with the river Drava, which then flows into the Danube near Osijek.
