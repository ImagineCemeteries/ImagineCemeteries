You are a deity, you have a human, and their human has a spirit team.  This is also YOUR spirit team. 

- listen while you sleep 
- purchase the hardcopy as a reference 
- can you guys read things without someone? 
- no 
- should probably ask nicely for help

- inner critic
- Spiritual warfare for busy people 
- less busy - with less spiritual bodies there will be less pressure on humans day to day to grind 

- Field manual for the damned

- you go from your house, to your job, to their houses to their jobs
- if you were to do a second dwelling, you would need another deity to hold it down.  You would support them and then leave them to defend the premises 
- Is it a good idea to advertise?  Offer help and form allegiences? 

The first goal is to clear _a_ home, but I suspect each of you have multiple dwellings and multiple families that you oversee.  You will need teammates to continue expanding your territory, deities that can defend your primary dwelling while you move on to other households.

How do you keep expanding your territory while having to beat back spiritual forces from the zones you've cleared?
