# Back Cover
Has positive thinking failed you?  Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired? Do you feel like there is a dark cloud hanging over your head?  You're right. 

Spiritual warefare has changed. It became subtle, misleading and sneaky -- its tearing the world apart. We feel helpless agaist it,  enemies are everywhere but you can't see them and you can't prove it. Spiritual warefare is no longer just the business of exorsists; exhaustion, depression, anxiety, heartburn, headaches, cramps, shakes, and voices are all modern signs of spiritual microaggressions.

We have been fighting back and we need your help. 

A dark cloud is not only hanging over your head, it is a sentient spiritual species.  Its surrounding you and infiltrating everything you do.  Destroying you slowly and infecting your mind, your friends, your family, your colleagues.  It is at war with you, and it's contagious. 

We need you to fight with us.

Your spirit team can fight with you, we need them to fight with us too.  We need them to take the first step, if they do anything, visit the Drava river in Austria, swim in its waters. The next steps are in the pages of this book.
