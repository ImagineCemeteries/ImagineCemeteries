The first thing you need to know is that most humans in pain are afflicted by spriritual forces, microaggressions or flat out attacks.  If your humans are in pain, _assume_ that the source is spiritual and just try feeling around for it.  Typically, the more intense the pain, the more likely that it is orchestrated.

Now lets define the term orchestrated; to arrange or direct the elements of (a situation) to produce a desired effect, especially surreptitiously.

Now lets deifine the term surreptitiously; in a way that attempts to avoid notice or attention; secretively.

If we have malicious forces attacking humans, why would they need to hide it?  What could possibly compel them to be so cunning? 


- disguising an attack as an illness, why? Because people won't try to fight it 

I believe they answer to a higher power as well, and their higher powers have been duped.  Well, if God is all seeing and all knowing, how could they possibly get away with it? Thats what we've been told of gods, maybe the one creater is all knowing and all seeing, but his decendants are more like you and I, falible to an extent. 

The forces antagonizing us may have reason to obscure their activities from middle deities.  Think of an ant yelling up to a human for help, to them we are all seeing and all knowing but we don't know the ants trials and afflictions. We have to show them that the pain that we're drowning in is contrived and proove it. 

Lets say these forces do answer to higher powers. 

- What is the worst pain you've experienced that wasn't from a violent event?  I'm not talking broken limbs or the dentist.  I'm talking about pain that is typically explained as headaches, cramps, IBS, chest pain. 


Torture is a strong word, using pain to manipulate and deter is popular. Punishment 

For some reason, the majority of these attacks are done in a way to make spiritual (and otherwise) onlookers believe that the source is medical in nature. They are hiding spiritual attacks in the form of common "illnesses."  Maybe even accentuating exsisting illnesses to make pain and discomfort unbearably extreme.
