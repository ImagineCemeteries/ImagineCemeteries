# Exercises - Keeping a Clear Head 
Its good enough if you just want to meditate on the Drave or the cemetary, but if you want to go pro then start by visiting the Drave or the cemetary, go to your target location and meditate on the Drave or the cemetary, and when you think you're done or just tuckered out, go back to the Drave or the cemetary again. Making in-person visits help with the fatigue that meditating for extended periods can cause.

# Exercises - The Drave 
Use this whenever you are feeling kind of gross.  The dark cloud's spiritual smog makes you feel icky.
