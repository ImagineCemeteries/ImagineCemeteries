Don't worry too much about convincing people to be better, feel better, you'll never know what ails them.  There are plenty of people out there who want this. 



# Exercises Summary - when to use
# our enemies 
    - dark cloud = depression, lethargy, irritability, social friction, anger, aggression
    - ghosts = anxiety, schitzophrenia, paranoia 
    - spheres = migraines, cramps

# Exercises - Relax and Prepare / Keeping a clear head
Its very important to us that you feel better than you did before reading this guide.  There are deities out here that are thinking about YOU and hoping the best for YOU. At the very least, rid yourself of any spiritual interference and use these exercises to set you up for success. 

    # Exercises - Shower
We recommend taking a daily "shower" in the Drave or the cemetary, whichever you prefer.  Cemetaries may actually be the most powerful places, they seem to be able to dissolve and absorb a variety of spiritual substances and entities -- maybe much more than we know -- where as the Drave seems to be most effective against the dark cloud's spiritual smog. We encourage you to test it yourself, or maybe alternate them if you prefer.

This practice will keep you fresh and sane, it clears your head and clenses your soul.  Use this time to think or plan, or just find peace.  Its hard to tell when and where you will run into nefarious spiritual forces, and as we've said, many entities like to spread out.  The world is _so_ over populated by spiritual forces, all of them are looking for areas of low spiritual pressure. So they are going to be coming straight for you for a while.  You can _always_ fall back to the cemetary or the Drave if you get overwhelmed. 

Use your time in the drave and cemetaries to cherish your individuality, your solitude, and recharge.

    # Exercises - Nourish Yourselves
Visit or meditate on the locations below for mental strength and fortitude: 

    1. Produce section at the grocery store
    2. Spice section at the grocery store 
    3. The tea section at the grocery store
    4. Vitamin Shoppe or GNC
    5. Biggest crystal store you know 
    6. The pharmacy at CVS, Walgreens or Walmart
    7. The Periodic Table of Elements - insert table 

    # Advanced
Okay, so lets say you have been very ambitious, you've been killing it, and you have built a team and your team is not fucking around. You all really want to nail this, destroy anything in your path and wallow in the peace and happiness. 

Its good enough if you just want to meditate on the Drave or the cemetary, but if you want to go pro then start by visiting the Drave or the cemetary, go to your target location and meditate on the Drave or the cemetary, and when you think you're done or just tuckered out, go back to the Drave or the cemetary again. Making in-person visits help with the fatigue that meditating for extended periods can cause.

Everytime you try this
- go to the cemetary first - team up, discuss your target
- do your meditation - visit the location and meditate in unison 
- go to the cemetary at the end - refresh and relax 

# Exercises - Eliminate the Opposition - Top 5 People
You've already practiced the Drave and the cemetary meditations in your home.  Even if it worked _very_ well, you will still feel the entities we've described honing in to your location for a while, maybe even months. 

To break up the monotany, you might consider practicing at multiple locations even if you can't defend them for very long.  Put yourself first, think of the top 5 people that drive you crazy, these people are likely afflicted by spiritual forces. Lets say its mostly ghosts, you can reap them with the cemetary meditation and though other ghosts will move in, they aren't the old ghosts that were giving you hell. 

I don't kwow how much this will help, its always possible that the human themselves is the asshole. But you can probably take the wind out of their sails. You've got all the time in the world, you might as well check it out.

# Exercises - The Cemetary 
Meditate on a cemetary tree 
Why is the tree important? - we think the cemetary is holy ground 
- Imagine yourself in a cemetary, imagine a tree in a cemetary, put your hand on the tree.
- by touching a tree in the cemetary, the dark cloud passess through your hands, through the root system of the tree and is distributed under the holy ground 
- why not a Church or a Mosque? You need the tree.  So unless you are planning to hug a tree outside of your place of worship (for an hour), its not going to work.
- You are brining your energy and all the energy of this HUGE "dark cloud" with you




# Exercises - Top 5 People

Center the tree over them, in some cases you will see a big smile emerge on their faces. It takes seconds to eradicate ghosts, and the joy that your humans experiece will be very gratifying.
