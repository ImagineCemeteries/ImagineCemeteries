- the dark cloud will try to consume deities, go back and foward between the Drave or a cemetary to slowly drain the dark cloud's energy

My prior company was invaded by a spiritual cybersec gang that carried a spiritual disease. Myself, my human colleagues and my spiritual colleagues where infected to various degrees. We call this the dark cloud. 

The dark cloud has some sentient abilities and is able to manipulate both human & spiritual hosts.  A small set of deities are immune to this disease, notably Ganesh.  The God of Grounding.

# A dark cloud is not only hanging over your head, it is a sentient spiritual species. 

The dark cloud has aspects of intelligence in its core, but they are gigantic and you can simply get caught up in its field. Its like a slug that crawls around and leaves a trail everywhere it goes, a trail that humans and spirits alike get stuck in.  Now think of it like a cloud that we're all caught in, at the perimeter the dark cloud is like spiriual smog, maybe akin to pollution but worse. 
- Its like spiritual pollution but worse.

# The Dark Cloud
The dark cloud isn't dark, you can't see it.  Its an analogy for "the dark cloud hanging over our heads."
- The dark clouds are what's holding us back, it makes everything go wrong
- Makes people irritable, lethargic, anxious, depressed
- It is as big as a cloud
- There are many dark clouds, somehow separate from each other but overlapping 
- It seems to come from above, cloud like in nature
- It appears to be sentient 
- It appears to want to possess / control us 
- It appears to be above us and come down through the roof in pipe-like energetic tentacles 
- It is slow moving, if you quickly side step you can move away from it 
- You can antagonize it to bait it 
- it has a connection to YOU, your human, your human's social circle, the other spirits and their spirits too
- Just an unchecked problem that has been going on for way too long

When we started this project we were surrounded by various dark clouds so our strategy was more Area of Effect than anything. 
- THe dark cloud has a tentacle like appendage it can use to move around your head
- Its as big as a cloud, the tentical is like a water hose with the other end in a pool 
- The dark cloud is slow, you can quickly move and it takes several seconds for it to catch up to you. 
- Most of it is outside and above you, the tentacle comes down through the roof in pipe-like energetic tunnels 
- If you go outside it has a stronger affect on your head because the majority of it is outside 
- You can grab the end of the pipe in their head to slowly drain it 
- It is contagious and spreads to the people in your surroundings 
- It mostly just surrounds you and tries to trap you in a spleepy brain fog 
- It can take humans and deities hostage, manipulating both their thoughts, words, behaviors and actions 
- If it is big enough, it can completely devour deities - more on this in my manual 
- It may have a nucleus that is sentient, but it is slow and stupid 
- stacked on top of each other but separate from each other

At the core of these dark clouds, there seems to be some sort of sentient being, sentient meaning that it thinks.  But it is slow minded and slow moving. 

Has the ability to engulf and surround humans, other life forms, deities, ghosts, and other spiritual life forms. 

The majority of the dark cloud is made up of some sort of spiritual smog that dissolves when it comes into contact with a variety of things, especially cemetaries. 

It is vulnerable to trees, spices, druges, liqour perscriptions, cemetaries and even imagining any of these things. 

There are no dark clouds in cemetaries, cemetaries are a spiritual dead zone. 


# Where 
Anywhere where wealth and power are concentrated, metropolitan areas. Any where where poverty and dispair are concentrated. 

The dark cloud is attracted to the same things we're all attracted to: money, power, influence. 

Alternatively, the dark cloud is also rampent in struggling communities such as trailer parks, jails. 

Primary motive is capturing as many people as possible in the "net" 

The dark cloud is contagious, spending time with afflicted people will "infect" you, and possibly "reinfect" you. All you need to do is establish a spot that you've cleared and imagine being in a cemetary until the bad vibes go away. You can also go to the cemetary directly, it only takes an hour to clear, if that. I am not sure how long it takes by just imaginining, you are in a cemetary, but you can always just go there to wash off. 

Dark cloud creates pressure in the head


Haven't mentioned that... some of you don't seem accustomed to meeting each other.  The dark cloud makes you hate each other, getting rid of the dark cloud makes it more possible to cohabitate 

- exceptions in business where many deities have been trained to cooperate but struggle to cohabitate in one person

three ways the dark cloud manifests 
- You're stuck in the dark cloud.  It goes where you go, you feel depressed, lethargic and frustrated and you can't escape. It has been going on so long that you think you are ill.  
- Directly - the dark cloud is actively targeting you.  You feel a pipe like energetic tentacle moving around your head or body.  You can move away from it quickly, but it will catch up to you if you stay in one spot
- Dieites / ghosts come visit, and have the dark cloud.  This feels like an immense pressure in your head for some reason, but it appears to come from the same place
- bubble in your head, grab it and put your hand on a tree in a cemetary



most of you don't want to fight a war, you barely want to get out of bed everyday.

We think the dark cloud is made up of a few different energies.  The majority of that energy is "unholy."  Cemetaries are holy groud, so thats why we think the cemetaries absorb the dark cloud.

# Dark Cloud Characteristics 
The dark cloud is comprised of three components that we can sense: 

    1. The dark cloud's spiritual field

        - This can be just as big as a cloud in the sky, this is what we are taking "chunks" out of.  We sometimes refer to this as "spiritual smog".  Before we discovered the Drave, eliminating the dark cloud was an endevour that took days, weeks, and even months. 

        - Getting caught in the dark cloud's web leads to lethargy and irritation.  I have speculated that spiritual smog could be the cause of depression. 

        - Its so big its impossible to escape.

    2. The dark cloud's tentacle 

        - The dark cloud has an infinite number of appendages that can feel like tentacles or cords attached to those they have captured.  Generally these are attached to your head, right above the brain stem.  It always seems to come from above, directly above your head. 

        - It is not permanently attached to you, quick motions such as side stepping or going for a jog will release you from its grasp, but the dark cloud is incessant and pervasive and will catch up to you when you stop. Again, its impossible to escape. 

    3. The dark cloud's nucleus 

        - The dark cloud's nucleus is basically its soul, or you can think of it like a brain. But it is slow thinking and slow moving; even if you are afflicted by the dark cloud, it doesn't even know we're talking about it right now. It is sentient, like a cranky senial person.  

        - I am not sure if this can be sensed by everyone, typically, the dark cloud just catches you in its web and generally ignores you. In my case, I was hell bent on destroying it, so during the last days it attacked me violently. 

        - To the best of my knowledge, after years of spiritual problems, the dark cloud can only cause chest pain. It does this by moving its tentacle from your head down into your chest and creating an energy that is close to a hot iron. The biggest threat that the dark cloud creates is lethargy and frustration, that you generally take out on your peers, friends and relatives. 

        - I can not emphasize enough that the dark cloud is both our biggest problem and our weakest enemy.  The problem is that they are enourmous, and though I have been reffering to a singular dark cloud, there are many, each of which can have a tentacle attached to a single human.  Eliminating them is time-consuming. 

What I'm teaching you to do here is how to eliminate the dark cloud.  

Everytime you try this
- go to the cemetary first 
- do your meditation 
- go to the cemetary at the end


After going through some of these energetic exercises, you 

This is when the dark cloud can become violent. 

I was attacked by the dark cloud at this point, but I also talked about nothing but how to eliminate the dark cloud for a year -- I believe it understood that I was the source of its destruction. I am not confident that every person in the dark cloud's web will experience the backlash that I did,

I am also not confident that every dark cloud has a tentacle in every person.  You are probably just caught in its spiritual field, so you may not need this step.  You may not ever encounter the dark cloud's tentacle at all. 


Let it surround and absorb you, let it smother you then fall back to the Drave.  Eventually you will destroy the majority of it and you can meditate on any stragglers.

Once we can remove the dark cloud, and you are _sure_ its gone, then take the time to feel your feels.  

Assuming that you got this far, the dark cloud is "naked", it is only comprised of its nucleus and its tentacle. 

# Our common enemies // and how to destroy them
You may have not defeated the dark cloud completely, but through out this process you may encounter increased spiritual activity from a variety of sources.

The majority of the dark cloud is made up of some sort of spiritual smog that dissolves when it comes into contact with a variety of things, especially cemetaries.

The first goal is to secure your home by draining the dark cloud and eliminating any spiritual interferance.
