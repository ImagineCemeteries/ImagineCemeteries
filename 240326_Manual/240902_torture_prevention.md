You'll notice in the list of symptoms below that that the majority of the dark cloud's abilities are under the "passive" category.  That means they don't have to actively try to manipulate you, it just comes naturally. The only intentional affliction I have experienced from the dark cloud is chest tension and pain. 

Typically the dark cloud comes down in a tube like form through the roof and its aiming for your head.  Usually the center, a few inches above your brainstem.  If you happen to threaten it somehow, occasionally that "tentcle" will dip down into your chest causing tension and pain. 

So if all the dark cloud can inflict on us is mild discomfort, why is the dark cloud our greatest enemy? Because their abilities are effortless, ongoing 24/7 365 days a year. Once it has you, you will frequently feel a variety of uncomfortable emotions listed below. 

Because most deities don't take prisoners.  The dark cloud takes everyone prisoner. 

Because feeling good and being happy in today's society is a prerequiset for success. 

Because angry deities cause pain and suffering, and the dark cloud is catching them and making them feel upset. 


.  A deity _can_ attack you for hours but compared to the dark cloud it's a drop in the bucket.  Dark clouds can destroy your life, deities can destroy your life too but they have to work at it in a way that the dark cloud doesn't 

The dark cloud makes you destroy your own life


Because in all reality its pretty difficult to piss off a deity.  And occasionally you get some of them just there for the laughs, 

Because we can do something about the dark cloud and we can't do anything about the deities except hope they like us. And the deities can save us from the dark cloud and the ghosts. 



# Passive side-effects vs active torture
Humans - some of you are in pain because your deity is in pain.  If you feel general discomfort or painful tingling throughout your body, Google a picture of the Drava river and meditate on it. Do both of you a favor. 

If you piss off a deity, you're gonna have a bad time.

But, as deities, it has little effect on you. In fact, fighting it is done by reaching in and touching where the pain is. It gives you a short high, like taking a drag off a cigarette when you haven't smoked in a while. 

One of the reasons for this chapter is that, some deities know they are doing this and other deities are like wtf. Seriously, someone has been doing this this whole time?!  The way I see it, is you have your special humans, the ones you look after, and occasionally or frequently they suffer crippling pain.  So this is not just an attack on your special human its an attack on you. All you have to do to fix it is reach in and touch where it hurts.  Humans are in agony, deities get a buzz off it.  



Things to look out for: 
- spheres mimick the abilities of deities.  People in pain my have a deity picking on them or just a stray sphere.  
- headaches - think of someone who has headaches all the time and try touching where the pain is
- cramps - same

Spheres don't need to concentrate to cause pain, but some "deities" can do the same thing.  They need to concentrate, so you have to sit still or lye still for them to do it. 

I have met a lot of deities and most of them are so powerful concentration isn't an issue. But it is for the ones causing the most problems. 

Spiritual attacks are meant to beat people down and keep them there. 

- we need to empower and enable
