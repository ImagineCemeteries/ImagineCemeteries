Torture prevention is easy.  It essentially amounts to a spirtual form generating a high energy beam that is horribly painful to humans.  But, as deities, it has little effect on you. In fact, fighting it is done by reaching in and touching where the pain is. It gives you a short high, like taking a drag off a cigarette when you haven't smoked in a while. 

- exhaustion, depression, anxiety, heartburn, headaches, cramps, shakes, and voices

Things to look out for: 
- spheres mimick the abilities of deities.  People in pan my have a deity picking on them or just a stray sphere.  
- headaches - think of someone who has headaches all the time and try touching where the pain is
- cramps - same

Spheres don't need to concentrate to cause pain, but some "deities" can do the same thing.  They need to concentrate, so you have to sit still or lye still for them to do it. 

I have met a lot of deities and most of them are so powerful concentration isn't an issue. But it is for the ones causing the most problems. 

Spiritual attacks are meant to beat people down and keep them there. 

- we need to empower and enable
