# Read this to your Spirit Guides
Do you hear voices?  Is there too many of them? Do they get along or do you have to listen to them arguing constantly? Is it just one "inner voice" that constantly critisizes you or complains? Every person has a spirit team, some spirits are better than others. But your spirit team can get rid of the others FOR YOU, and that's why this message is for them.  

During quarentine of 2020 my colleagues "higher selves" took it upon themselves to rudely "awaken" me. Before hand I had no experience with spirituality or spiritual entities. I was an "I don't believe it if I can't see it" engineer, a dancer, and I liked to sing, play games and I spent plenty of time in virtual reality.

Well they showed me. 

They were vicious, and my awakening led to years of spiritual torture. Seizures, shakes, insomnia, possession, depression, things today that are considered "medical issues". But almost worse, they NEVER shut up.  From the moment I woke up in the morning to the moment I went to bed, it was like living in a stadium full of people there simply to demean and degrade me. 

But spirits are not all made equal. I studied these beings to learn how to stop them. My goal is to teach your spirt guides how to thin the crowd without drawing their wrath.

Along the way, I learned to tell the difference between Holy Spirits and otherwise. I learned that Holy Spirits are outnumbered thirty to one, despite your awesome powers. And you didn't know what to do about it anymore than I did at the time. I often use the analogy of a tribe of garden gnomes tying down a giant and holding him prisoner.  These other spirits seem to "dissappear" --- for good, if you spend time in a cemetary or even imagine being there. 

How can you tell if you're a Holy Spirit? The concept might be foreign to many of you.  Most of my close spirit friends officially identify as Demons, for the most part as a joke.  But still, many of you aren't used to being seen as the good guy or gal. You are.  And the other kind will do whatever they can to demonize you -- but you don't have to take that shit. 

If you've been to a cemetery and came back, or can imagine being there, then you are what I consider a Holy Spirit. I don't use words like ghost, demon or god, there is only spirits and Holy Spirits.  The best part is, these arrogant little shits will immeadiately evaporate in your pressence if you simply imagine a cemetary. Why? Because I'm an American and cemeteries are the only HOLY GROUND I know of. 




Some of you can not be stopped and its not my goal to stop you, but I have discovered how to eliminate the opposition.  





I believe we share common interests. 


The first thing I need to emphasize is that if you have ever been to a cemetery or other holy ground, this message is for you and you are far beyond both 

# Modern Spirits - Like leadership 
This isn't a haunted house story, this is 2024.  Spirits don't possess houses anymore, they possess people, businesses, colleges and even parents or children.   


If you are reading this message

There is a difference between holy spirits and otherwise, what I'm trying to explain here is that 90% of spiritual entities in today's world are otherwise.  





# What is spiritual torture
Have you ever been to a cemetery?  Walked through, took a look around, hung out for a bit? If you have, this message is for you.  

Deities that can travel vs deities that can not 

- most ghosts seem really inexperienced (immature) compared to deities. 
- such as comparing someone who has exsisted 1000 years to someone who has exsisted 200

Think about the top 5 people in your life that drive you crazy.  People who are always wanting something from you, always nagging you, always degrading you.  These people have a high probablility of being possessed by ghosts. 

Deities - Another significant difference between deities is that they don't target your head. 


Deities - The majority of deities are highly intelligent, very reasonable and open-minded, laid back and permissive.  Independant. Ambient electricity, tingling, static electricity 

    - toxic positivity 
    - vibing too high  

        - deities vs superbeings
    - superbeings can go where ever they want
