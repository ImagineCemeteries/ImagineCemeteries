Imagine yourself in a cemetary, imagine a tree in a cemetary, put your hand on the tree. 

Go to a cemetary? Field trip. 

Why is the tree important? 
- we think the cemetary is holy ground 
- You are brining your energy and all the energy of this HUGE "dark cloud" with you
- The dark cloud will start to drain through the cemetary but it is attached to your body
- if you are wearing shoes, very little will happen 
- by touching a tree in the cemetary, the dark cloud passess through your hands, through the root system of the tree and is distributed under the holy ground 
- why not a Church or a Mosque? You need the tree.  So unless you are planning to hug a tree outside of your place of worship (for an hour), its not going to work. 

If you feel a sense of dread going into a cemetary, it is likely the feelings of beings that would be absorbed by the cemetary.  The more you dread it, the more you should push through and take a walk through the cemetary.  If you stick to the side walk most spiritual forms will make it through, but if you walk on the grounds these creatures will be absorbed by the cemetary 

So you've been to the cemetary for a bit and you don't feel like the world is on your shoulders anymore?  Well get ready because it gets better.  

The cemetary process is a little different and takes longer than just going for a dip, but it is neccessary for everyone whether you can travel internationally or not. 


Take a daily "shower" in the cemetary 


For some reason, if you visit the cemetary in person you come out feeling like a million dollars, but if you meditate on the cemetary you will feel drained.
