# The Dark Cloud
The dark cloud isn't dark, you can't see it.  Its an analogy for "the dark cloud hanging over our heads."
- The dark clouds are what's holding us back, it makes everything go wrong
- Makes people irritable, lethargic, anxious, depressed
- It is as big as a cloud
- There are many dark clouds, somehow separate from each other but overlapping 
- It seems to come from above, cloud like in nature
- It appears to be sentient 
- It appears to want to possess / control us 
- It appears to be above us and come down through the roof in pipe-like energetic tentacles 
- It is slow moving, if you quickly side step you can move away from it 
- You can antagonize it to bait it 

cord (cord cutting)
rope 
string
yarnball / brainstorm 
bubble / leaky pipe

When we started this project we were surrounded by various dark clouds so our strategy was more Area of Effect than anything. 
- THe dark cloud has a tentacle like appendage it can use to move around your head
- Its as big as a cloud, the tentical i slike a water hose with the other end in a pool 
- The dark cloud is slow, you can quickly move and it takes several seconds for it to catch up to you. 
- Most of it is outside and above you, the tentacle comes down through the roof in pipe-like energetic tunnels 
- If you go outside it has a stronger affect on your head because the majority of it is outside 
- You can grab the end of the pipe in their head to slowly drain it 
- It is contagious and spreads to the people in your surroundings 
- It mostly just surrounds you and tries to trap you in a spleepy brain fog 
- It can take humans and deities hostage, manipulating both their thoughts, words, behaviors and actions 
- If it is big enough, it can completely devour deities - more on this in my manual 
- It may have a nucleus that is sentient, but it is slow and stupid 

- stacked on top of each other but separate from each other

At the core of these dark clouds, there seems to be some sort of sentient being, sentient meaning that it thinks.  But it is slow minded and slow moving. 

Has the ability to engulf and surround humans, other life forms, deities, ghosts, and other spiritual life forms. 

The majority of the dark cloud is made up of some sort of spiritual smog that dissolves when it comes into contact with a variety of things, especially cemetaries. 

It is vulnerable to trees, spices, druges, liqour perscriptions, cemetaries and even imagining any of these things. 

There are no dark clouds in cemetaries, cemetaries are a spiritual dead zone. 


# Where 
Anywhere where wealth and power are concentrated, metropolitan areas. Any where where poverty and dispair are concentrated. 

The dark cloud is attracted to the same things we're all attracted to: money, power, influence. 

Alternatively, the dark cloud is also rampent in struggling communities such as trailer parks, jails. 

Primary motive is capturing as many people as possible in the "net" 

The dark cloud is contagious, spending time with afflicted people will "infect" you, and possibly "reinfect" you. All you need to do is establish a spot that you've cleared and imagine being in a cemetary until the bad vibes go away. You can also go to the cemetary directly, it only takes an hour to clear, if that. I am not sure how long it takes by just imaginining, you are in a cemetary, but you can always just go there to wash off. 

Dark cloud creates pressure in the head
