Ghosts know who the deities are, but deities don't know who ghosts are 
Ghosts thinking they are gods and gods thinking they are ghosts 


Spiritual entities are all drawn to similar things, power, wealth, influence. 

- we need them to know they are deities not ghosts? 
- we'll teach you how to eliminate your adversaries 

Secret time.  You're NOT a ghost! 

Also, you can go to a cemetary and 

I want them to know they can go to a cemetary 

Until now, I've referred to those who pick up this book generally as "spirits," but there is X amount of common spirits and this book is directed to deities; those that can fight and win a spiritual war. 

You are also immune to cemetaries. 

If you often have people running to you for this, that or the other, you're the deity. Additionally, those people driving you crazy are haunted, they're spirit teams have ghosts. 

But in this book we are going to emphasize the abilities of deities to yada

so if we are trying to pray to a deity about all the ghosts, we're gonna have a bad time 

so if I'm complaining to a deity about the ghost problem, and I know they are a deity, the ghosts know they are a deity, but the deity think their a ghost, that causes a lot of problems for me. 

ghosts have very clear weaknesses that deities don't share. 

deities are meant to save us

and ghosts mean to destroy us. Also, 

Who are we fighting? Ghosts. How do we fight them? All you have to do is imagine a cemetary enclosing them. They just dissappear, get reaped, raptured whatever. 

We were lied to, ghosts don't come from cemetaries, they need to go to cemetaries. 

Trust, what would make them believe 

Imagine a cemetary, imagine a tree in a cemetary and put your hand on it... Still here? Congrats, you're a deity! 

You need to know you are not a ghost because I want you to go to the cemetary.  Cemetaries absorb ghosts, so we're rolling the dice here... but not really. 

It is important to distinguish the difference between a ghost and a deity.

The problem is,   This is a huge problem.  You need to know what you are, and how you differ from other spiritual entities to understand what you can do. 

It is a huge problem because if I'm talking to what I believe are gods, complaining about the ghost problem then those deities have retaliated against me. 

self-reliant, can go anywhere

Because there are such things as deities and such things as ghosts, and the people who are going to win this war are not ghosts. It is imperitive that you know who you are, and what you are, to be able to understand what you can do and how you can win. 

So how do you explain the difference between a ghost and a diety? You have a variety of characteristics that differ from ghosts, but we'll only be going over two in this section. 

1. You are self-reliant - you take matters into your own hands, you may struggle to ask for help, you feel the world is on your shoulders

In contrast, ghosts like to be served.  If there is a problem they are going to whine to anyone who will listen.  Important thing to note here, though some deities believe they are ghosts, ghosts are _well_ aware of who is a deity and will come crying to you at a moments notice.  Because they know you can make things go their way. 

My most important job with this book is identifying deities that think they are ghosts. 

Self-reliant, take matters into their own hands

What do I say that won't scare them away? 

Do you think you're a ghost? WRONG BUCKO 

Aside from the dark cloud, the big problem are ghosts. 

The big problem aside from the dark cloud are ghosts. 

The line in the sand is who can survive passing through a cemetary.  

I have ran into a variety of spiritual kind throughout the years, my absolute favorite are the deities. After years of miscommunication, I realized that some deities identify as ghosts. That created a huge problem because I was trying to kill ghosts. Actual ghosts. And I talked about it to anyone who would listen to me. So how do I describe the difference between a ghost and a deity? 

Have you ever considered that you are a deity? 

If you are reading this you are probably a deity. 


There are X of spiritual kinds we find commonly in any environment.  We're no longer talking haunted houses here, we're talking haunted people, haunted businesses, haunted celebrities, and haunted governments. Spirits of all kind want the same things that we want, money, power, stability, prestige. 

Spiritual entities are all drawn to similar things, power, wealth, influence. 

The biggest problem, aside from the dark cloud is ghosts.  For me especially, it was a HUGE problem because I felt I was in the company of deities, but those deities thought they were ghosts and balked when I told them I wanted to destroy them. 


So far, I've been calling you all spirits but we are at war with some spiritual kind.  


If you are hearing voices and you can't bear it any longer, _you can_ participate in any of the meditations in this guide, though your spirit team's help will be invaluable.  To eradicate the voices, Google an image of a cemetary.  Study it, memorize it and envision it around you.
