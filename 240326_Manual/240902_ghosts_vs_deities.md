Ghosts know who the deities are, but deities don't know who ghosts are 
Ghosts thinking they are gods and gods thinking they are ghosts 


Spiritual entities are all drawn to similar things, power, wealth, influence.

- we'll teach you how to eliminate your adversaries 

Secret time.  You're NOT a ghost!
