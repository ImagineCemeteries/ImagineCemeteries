   - exercises - top 3 people etc 

 
Do you hear voices? Are they aggressive, nagging, demeaning or degrading? Are you sick of it? Are you sick of hiding it? Do you want someone to talk to? Do you want to do something about it? Do you want them to just SHUT UP?

Well I'm here to tell you that you CAN do something about it.  And it's EASY.  Just watch this WHOLE video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ia3tiggDlw

I don't have a business and this is not my video, I found this video while I was looking for cemetery YouTube content.  I've discovered that most spiritual incarnations are VERY vulnerable to cemeteries.  Just watching a video of a cemetery can keep them quiet.  I just want to help people who share the same experiences as I've had with irritating spiritual entities. 

Join us in my BRAND NEW GROUP: https://www.facebook.com/groups/207628412444807 if you are telepathic or you hear the voices of spirits and want to have REAL conversations with REAL people with the same talents. 

Our experiences may differ, but if you can watch the video for 20 minutes you should feel immense relief. This is a work in progress, and I need YOUR feedback to help others.  Join my group ImagineCemeteries for more info, questions, feedback and even complaints.  

I am working on developing custom content.  Thank you for your participation, I feel your struggle. I will be uploading my own cemetery exploration video's soon, for more information join my group ImagineCemeteries.

Want to try this without a crutch? Next time you hear a voice you don't want to hear, just try imagining a cemetary for the next few minutes.  Set a timer on your phone and try envisioning yourself in a cemetary for 5 minutes.  If you can't remember a cemetary or imagining one is  a struggle for you, try watching this video of a cemetary.  It will be the best self help video you will ever watch. 

This is not a sales venture, I will have donation options available (eventually) but you will never be expected to pay for any content provided by ImageineCemetaries.
