# Welcome Humans! 
Help your spirit team HELP YOU! Read THIS to your spirit guides!

# Who
We are a spiritual coalition that has discoverd a spiritual plague impacting us all.  The good guys, the bad guys, the ugly guys. We have been working together to find a solution.  It doesn't matter what team you play for, we want YOUR help. 
 
 # What - The Dark Cloud - "Spiritual Smog" 
 The "dark cloud" is not dark, you can't see it - but its as big as a cloud.  It is like spiritual smog.  

- If you get rid of the dark cloud, everyone feels better. Angels, demons, ghosts, spirits, all of us, whatever you identify as. 
    
- We can't change anyone's nature, but the dark cloud affects us all.  We can teach you how to get rid of the dark cloud that hangs over us all. 

# How - Get Rid of the Dark Cloud
 We can't change who "we" are or what "we" do.  We being non-physical people, but we would like everyone on all sides to join us & help get rid of this spiritual smog.  This is how you get rid of your own personal dark cloud: 

  1. First you have to imagine a tree in a cemetary, the tree is IMPORTANT.

  2. Lay your hand on the tree in the cemetary. 

  3. Imagine the cemetary around the tree.  Expand as far as possible.

  4. Imagine for about an hour. 

  - Even if you don't get it perfect it works.  All you need to do is imagine yourself in a cemetary touching a tree.  Or you can just imagine a cemetary and it still works. 
    
  5. Is it too boring?  Yeah it is.  The other option is to go to a cemetary, and put your hand on a tree for an hour. 

  6. Isn't that _also_ boring?  No! Its NOT!  It was just kind of weird to open with. You don't have to concentrate, if you stay the whole hour you'll feel amazing. 

This has never not worked for us, so assuming you tried it you should be feeling a lot better now. 

The dark cloud is a spiritual plague, it is contagious and you will probably get reinfected, _especially_ from the areas you return to. Its basically everywhere in Florida, so you are probably going to go right back to where you got it from. We recommend taking a spiritual "shower" every day in the cemetary, in person.  If you happen to avoid all other big dark clouds, the effect lasts about 3 months (because you will probably pick up little ones as you go about your life). It has something to do with electric charges, its an opposites attract type sort of thing.  As a deity you are negatively charged, the dark cloud is positively charged.  Negative is good, toxic positivity bad. 

Also, we recognise that some of you believe you are ghosts.  If you are reading this you are probably _not_ a ghost, but if you fear cemetaries thats why we recomend you just imagine it first.    

PS Humans: TBD

This spiritual smog affects us all, and areas of high pressure move to areas of low pressure; so at first you can't "cure" it, but you can have TREMENDOUS RELEIF. Imagine putting your hands on a tree in a cemetary and keep it there until you feel GREAT.  Do it again everytime you don't feel GREAT. 

# What's next? 
Well its everywhere, so if you want to change it you'll have to work for it. 

  1. Start with yourself first, we recommend going in person.

  2. Well, you can't just stay there forever right?  This is where the *imagine cemetaries exercise* is so important.  You can go anywhere, and if you don't like the way it feels you can imagine a cemetary to make it feel better.  Its just tedious and slow going. 

  3. Teach this to as many people as possible and form TEAMS.  BIG ONES. Do it together! Its easy once you get started.

  4. With a big team, the effect goes much faster, but it will still take you between a few hours and a few days to clear "a zone".  What is a zone?  Well that is a hard thing to measure but we started with a simple house.  Probably not an apartment complex or anything.  Think about someone you care about who always seems to be miserable, start there.
