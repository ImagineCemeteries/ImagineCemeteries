 Do you hear voices? Are they aggressive, nagging, demeaning or degrading? Are you sick of it? Are you sick of hiding it? Do you want someone to talk to? Do you want to do something about it? Do you want them to just SHUT UP?

Well I'm here to tell you that you CAN do something about it.  And it's EASY.  Just watch this WHOLE video. I found this video while I was looking for YouTube content with cemetaries.  I will be uploading custom content soon, for more information join my facebook group ImagineCemeteries.

Just try imagining a cemetary for the next few minutes.  Set a timer on your phone and try envisioning yourself in a cemetary for 5 minutes.  If you can't remember a cemetary or imagining one is  a struggle for you, try watching this video of a cemetary.  It will be the best self help video you will ever watch. 

Want to know more? Want people to talk to about this secret issue that plauges so many of us?  Join my facebook group for relief, community and details. 

This is not a sales venture, I will have donation options available (eventually) but you will never be expected to pay for any content provided by ImageineCemetaries.
