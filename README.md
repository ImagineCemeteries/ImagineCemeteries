 Who 240112 - 

  We are coworkers that have many of the same issues this hospital faces.  We have been working together to find a solution.  We can't change who "we" are or what "wee" do.  We being non-physical people.  But we figured out something important along the way.  
 
 What 240112 - The Dark Cloud - "Spiritual Smog" 

 The "dark cloud" isn't not dark, you can't see it - but its as big as a cloud.  It is like spiritual smog.  
    - If you get rid of the dark cloud, everyone feels better.  The good guys, the bad guys, and the ugly guys. 
    - We can't change anyone's nature, but the dark cloud affects us all.  We can teach you how to get rid of the dark cloud that hangs over us all. 







 How 240302 - Get Rid of the Dark Cloud
