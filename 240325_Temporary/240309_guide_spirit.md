# Read this to your SPIRIT TEAM 
    - tie this back to the dark cloud

So you've been practicing imagining yourself in a cemetary, the first thing you notice is its *so quiet*. Congradulations, those voices you heard aren't coming back. If they do, just imagine a cemetary. 

So what am I insinuating here? I'll just come out and say it.  Those weren't spirits breathing down your neck, they were GHOSTS.  Legitimately cheating death and judgement and you just sent those bastards straight back to where they belong. Feels good huh? Sure does! Revenge is sweet. 

PS - we had a big problem with the "ghost" term in the beginning.  Apparently there are some Holy Spirits that identify with the term "ghost".  They can identify all they want, but they are not ghosts. Angel, Holy Spirit, deity, etc probably, but not ghosts. Anyways, this caused some static and some pain on my end until I stopped using the G-word word so much.

Here's the catch, this doesn't work on *every* spirit, just the most obnoxious ones. Generally the ones that are most aggressive, nagging, demeaning or degrading. Whats left now are your Holy Spirits, your REAL spirit team. Or just very talented human psychics. 

As far as I can tell, obnoxious spirits make up about 90% of our spiritual demography. So in short, I can only help with 90% of the problem. Good luck with the last 10%. 

I use the word Holy Spirit librally, as what's left after imagining the cemetary *can* easily be as aggressive as the other ones, but not typically. What they are though, is immune to this exercise, and more specifically, holy ground. 

The best part is, if you feel better after watching the video, your Holy Spirits feel better too. 

One more catch, those voices left behind some sort of bad vibes.  I call this the dark cloud or spiritual smog.  Its EASY to get rid of most of the voices, the smog they leave behind though is usually far more time consuming. 

The good news is, all you need to do is the same exact thing.  It takes about an hour to clear the air of the smog they left behind, and honestly, it will keep coming back.  If you watch the cemetary video once a day, it should put a huge dent in it. 

I suspect this works so well because cemetaries are holy ground.  I am not religious so personally I have never seen any other holy ground other than a cemetary.  I don't know what else would work, I am trying to stay religiously agnostic so that I can get as diverse a group as possible to join our efforts. Thats includes everyone, ESPEACIALLY YOU.  But also:

Christians
Witches 
Catholics
Scientologists 
Hindu - Hindi? 
Quakers
Pastafarians
Whatever 

What ever you identify with we don't care, JOIN US. 

We are religiously agnostic because this is a spiritual war. That means every religion shares the same problem and we don't want to alienate ANY of them, we want to join forces with everyone to knock this out.
