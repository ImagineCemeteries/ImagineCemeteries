# Introduction 
Hey Deities, welcome to my channel on Spiritual Warfare where I teach deities about other spiritual life forms and how to destroy them.  Why?  Because they are crowding your head, fighting for control of your humans, and making you both sick and miserable.  If you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, listen to what we've got. 

Me and my team of spiritual professionals have discovered a spiritual parasite affecting humans and deities alike.  We're trying to share the solution with as many people as we can reach. 



You got problems? Issues?  Well we're going to eliminate them. We're going to teach you about what you are and how to get rid of the rest of them.

# disclaimer
Spiritual warfare is not a replacement for pschiactric support.  In fact, if you are a troubled human or a troubled soul, those troubling you may need all the help they can get.  In my videos, I emphasize the relationship between human nutrition and your spiritual nutrition.  Remember there's only one of you, and if you are struggling, there are probably a lot of spirtual entities struggling with you. Seek pschiatric guidance and just tell them your symptoms, see what they can do for you.
