Who

  We are coworkers that have many of the same issues this hospital faces.  We have been working together to find a solution.  We can't change who "we" are or what "we" do.  We being non-physical people.  But we figured out something important along the way.  
 
 What - The Dark Cloud - "Spiritual Smog" 

 The "dark cloud" isn't not dark, you can't see it - but its as big as a cloud.  It is like spiritual smog.  
    - If you get rid of the dark cloud, everyone feels better.  The good guys, the bad guys, and the ugly guys. 
    - We can't change anyone's nature, but the dark cloud affects us all.  We can teach you how to get rid of the dark cloud that hangs over us all. 

 How - Get Rid of the Dark Cloud

 We would like everyone on all sides to join us & help get rid of this spiritual smog.

    1. First you have to imagine a tree in a cemetary, the tree is IMPORTANT.

    2. Imagine the tree is actually covering some struggling person's body.

    3. Imagine the cemetary around the tree.  Expand as far as possible.

    * Even if you don't get it perfect it works. Start with yourself first, all you need to do is imagine yourself in a cemetary touching a tree and it still works.  Or you can just imagine a cemetary and it still works. 

    4. Teach this to as many people as possible and form TEAMS.  BIG ONES. Its easy once you get started.

This spiritual smog affects us all, and areas of high pressure move to areas of low pressure; so at first you can't "cure" it, but you can have TREMENDOUS RELEIF. Imagine putting your hands on a tree in a cemetary and keep it there until you feel GREAT.  Do it again everytime you don't feel GREAT.
