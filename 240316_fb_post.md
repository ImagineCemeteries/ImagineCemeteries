The rules say I can self-promote on Mondays, please remove my post if this is not allowed.  This isn't actually promoting a business, I am trying to find and help witches that have serious spirit problems similar to the ones I've had.

Do you hear voices? Are they aggressive, nagging, demeaning or degrading? Are you sick of it? Are you sick of hiding it? Do you want someone to talk to? Do you want to do something about it? Do you want them to just SHUT UP?

Well I'm here to tell you that you CAN do something about it.  And it's EASY.  Just watch this WHOLE video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ia3tiggDlw

I don't have a business and this is not my video, I found this video while I was looking for cemetery YouTube content.  I've discovered that most spiritual incarnations are VERY vulnerable to cemeteries.  Just watching a video of a cemetery can keep them quiet.  I just want to help people who share the same experiences as I've had with irritating spiritual entities. 

Join us in my BRAND NEW GROUP: https://www.facebook.com/groups/207628412444807 if you are telepathic or you hear the voices of spirits and want to have REAL conversations with REAL people with the same talents. 

Our experiences may differ, but if you can watch the video for 20 minutes you should feel immense relief. This is a work in progress, and I need YOUR feedback to help others.  Join my group ImagineCemeteries for more info, questions, feedback and even complaints.  

I am working on developing custom content.  Thank you for your participation, I feel your struggle. I will be uploading my own cemetery exploration video's soon, for more information join my group ImagineCemeteries.
