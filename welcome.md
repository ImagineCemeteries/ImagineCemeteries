How we can help
Good Feeling Explanation 
 - The good feeling is an experience that happenes when you get multiple entities to imagine a cemetary together.  It feels like a high but it isn't, its simply the absense of friction, doubt and lethargy. And all the other symptoms that come with the dark cloud.  Means they cleared it. 

 - It can last for days, but usually hours, depending on the area that you clear. 

 Force Multiply - We need to identify types of groups that have the ability to organize and execute as teams. Doing this individually is not impossible, but it takes weeks/ months. The groups I've identified are: 

 - Cybersec 
 - Vets

 Many groups have a desire to support and assist but not the ability to coordinate.
